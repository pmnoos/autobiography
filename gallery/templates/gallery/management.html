<h1>How Management Rights Work in Australia</h1>
with Ownership of a Manager’s Unit</h1>

<p>The person or company managing the complex usually owns an apartment in the building.
This unit is typically included in the purchase of the management rights.
A Caretaking Agreement

The manager is responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of common areas (gardens, pools, hallways, etc.).
This agreement is signed with the body corporate (owners’ committee) and provides a guaranteed income.
Letting Rights (Rental Management Business)

The manager acts as a rental agent for property owners in the complex.
They manage rentals, find tenants, handle bookings (for holiday apartments), and receive commission-based income.
This is where the main profit comes from, especially in tourist areas.
Financing and Buying Management Rights

Buying management rights is like purchasing a business—a bank loan is often required.
Agreements usually last 5-25 years, depending on state laws (Queensland allows longer agreements than other states).
Types of Management Rights
Permanent – Managing long-term rental apartments.
Holiday Letting – Managing short-term rentals for tourists.
Corporate Letting – Catering to business travelers.
Mixed Use – A combination of the above.</p>
