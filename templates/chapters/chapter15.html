            <h2><h2 style="text-align: center;">Starting Magner Knitwear</h2></h2>
        
 <hr>       
        <div class="content">
            <p>After the first year or so, we completed the retaining walls, which was a condition of our mortgage requiring us to install a wall along the length of the driveway. The surrounding garden was laid out and finished with the help of Henry, who was one of the gardeners at a royal estate in Wrexham, Bucks, UK. Anything he planted just thrived. I remember one time he came home with what appeared to be a bundle of dead twigs. He planted them in a row in the front garden, and within a few months, we had beautiful flowering azaleas that grew into a lovely hedge. With the garden completed, my work with the airline remained steady, allowing me the time and motivation to pursue a side project for extra income. Although I was working part-time as a waiter in an upscale restaurant, where about six flight attendants also worked during their off days, I wanted to create something more. Sheila began to get into her knitting on a Passap 12, a very basic machine that could perform a limited number of well-known stitches by pushing cams left and right on the knitting bed. Despite its limitations, Sheila did remarkably well with what she had. Through an ad in the local newspaper looking for knitters, she received a few orders for baby knitwear, including little booties, mittens, and bonnets. One day, after completing a small order, I took her to meet her agent. He presented Sheila with a garment and asked if she could reproduce it on her machine. This was where it all truly began&mdash;Magner Knitwear. The item was what they called "crawlers," an all-in-one pair of knitted pants for babies. We took the garment home, examined its construction, and came up with a design for our machine. After many attempts, we finally produced a garment that resembled the crawler. We brought it back to the agent to see if it met his standards and to discuss pricing, quantities, and timelines since production was quite time-consuming. Additionally, sourcing knitting yarn in New Zealand was challenging; most raw materials were imported and required an import license. As we discussed these challenges, the agent mentioned he had a business and could provide us with the yarn. He gave us a price he would pay, so we returned home determined to find a faster, more efficient way to produce these garments.<br>We reached out to Passap knitting machines, based in Switzerland, and they recommended upgrading to the Duomatic, a more advanced machine that could be placed on a stand with an electric motor to drive it left and right. It came with plenty of great accessories to enhance our knitting production. It was a no-brainer; we felt it would be a worthwhile investment. We could sell the Passap 12, recoup some of our costs from the UK, and perhaps even make a little profit from selling it in New Zealand due to the import licensing. That&rsquo;s how it all started. When the new machine arrived, we both dove into learning how to use the Passap Duomatic. Over time, we acquired all the latest accessories to make our work on the machine quicker and more efficient. The finished garment was now an all-in-one piece with a shaped toe and heel for little feet, requiring only two places for extra sewing to complete the crawler, which could be done in just a few minutes.<br>It wasn't long before we realized that we had the beginnings of a small business. Our little baby, Carolyn, became the model for our creations as we perfected the crawlers. We purchased another machine so that when I wasn't flying, we could both produce garments. The range was expanding significantly, and it was only a matter of designing a little coat to create pram sets, along with other items like bootees, mittens, bonnets, and matinee jackets. We decided to venture out on our own to sell our baby wear. We bought a shelf company named Mickycliff Pty Ltd and introduced Magner Knitwear to a company that sold to clothing stores. These companies would travel the country to obtain future orders, a process we learned is called indenting. We applied for an import license to bring in our own yarn. After receiving our first indented order, it became clear that we had taken on more than we could handle. We faced a decision: either reduce our range or bite the bullet by purchasing more machines, training people to operate them, and hiring outworkers to sew the garments. At the same time, I wasn't ready to give up my job at Air NZ, as it was too early in the creation of Magner Knitwear. Besides, we needed the income to live on, as raw materials had to be bought and outworkers needed to be paid..<br>We carried on this way for the coming year. Henry proposed to Francis and, happily, she accepted.&nbsp;<a title="Henry and Francis" href="../../../media/images/HenryFrancis.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">They married,</a> and it was a lovely thing to witness. After their wedding, Henry moved out, and they found a nice little unit to live together happily. This change opened the door for us to move on as well, especially since the children were growing so quickly and the knitting supplies were taking up too much space in our home. We decided to place the house on Gordon Ave on the market. Eventually, we found a bigger home not far away at Chambells Bay&mdash;274 Beach Rd, to be precise. It had five bedrooms, a lovely old English garden, and a huge deck perfect for outdoor dining. Set back from the main road, it was quiet despite being on a busy thoroughfare leading to the beach on the North Shore. We settled well into Beach Rd, and the children were very happy with a beach just across the road. Their joy flowed through to Sheila, making her content as well. At Air NZ, I was promoted to senior steward, where I looked after all the economy passengers on a DC-8 and all passengers on the Lockheed Electra, along with the crew I flew with.<br>I have wonderful memories of Beach Rd, where we bought our first caravan. New Zealand was the perfect country for camping, caravan trips, and bushwalking. There were so many breathtaking places to explore, with rivers flowing with beautiful, ice-cold water from the mountains. These locations made ideal spots for overnight stops, allowing us to visit surrounding areas of interest. During the summers, we would load up the caravan and travel to various sites, enjoying long weekends filled with adventure. Each trip was an opportunity to reconnect with nature, create lasting memories, and bond as a family.<br>Other Great Memories from Beach Rd The amazing kitchen at Beach Rd had plenty of room, and we upgraded it at the time when wall ovens were all the rage. With multi-use cooktops, I was excited to bring back the latest trends and gadgets from my trips to the USA, which I installed in our kitchen. With my background in hospitality, it was an easy transition to continue the tradition of afternoon teas at Beach Rd. We often baked a great variety of well-known sponges, cream cakes, and more. Everything was beautifully arranged on a lovely brass trolley, accompanied by assorted sandwiches, all cut into little triangles. We would invite Henry and Francis to join us, along with other friends. Thinking back, every meal we shared at Beach Rd felt like a gourmet experience. My time working in the airline industry, where I prepared meals for first-class passengers, also contributed to this. I would have been in the first-class galley, preparing food using only the finest ingredients, all meticulously installed by the ground catering department. I suppose as well it all goes back to Clare House, where Mum and Dad always provided us with the best food, preparing everything with care and attention to detail.</p>
