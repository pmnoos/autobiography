            <p data-start="141" data-end="193"><strong data-start="141" data-end="191">How We Got the Apartment and Management Rights</strong></p>
<p data-start="195" data-end="316">We owe it all to Cliff and Zoe. It&rsquo;s a great story that truly shows how some people go out of their way to help others.</p>
<p data-start="318" data-end="549">I first knew Matt Miller from Air NZ&mdash;he was senior to me, and we flew together many times in my early days with the airline. After I left Air NZ, I lost touch with everyone. That was until one day, Cliff and Zoe came to visit us.</p>
<p data-start="551" data-end="630">As always, Cliff, with his dry wit, said, &ldquo;I have an offer you can&rsquo;t refuse.&rdquo;</p>
<p data-start="632" data-end="793">I laughed and thought, <em data-start="655" data-end="688">where have I heard that before?</em> Oh yes&mdash;when he offered me that Italian restaurant in Weyba Rd, Noosaville. What a lemon that was!</p>
<p data-start="795" data-end="1307">Anyway, I listened. The deal was this: Matt Miller had purchased the management rights to Bali Hai, along with the apartment. He and his wife had run the place for nearly a year when their daughter fell seriously ill in New Zealand. They wanted to be with her. At the time, Cliff and Zoe still owned Scoffers Inn, so they proposed a straight swap with Matt and his wife&mdash;giving them Scoffers Inn in exchange for Bali Hai&mdash;so they could free themselves to be with their daughter. And that&rsquo;s exactly what happened.</p>
<p data-start="1309" data-end="1524">Then, knowing I was at a loose end, Cliff offered Bali Hai to me. The arrangement was simple: we would move in, run the place, build credibility, and</p>
<p data-start="1309" data-end="1524">then try to secure financing to buy it outright from Cliff and Zoe.</p>
<p data-start="1526" data-end="1699">And that&rsquo;s exactly what we did. Within a year, it was officially ours&mdash;mortgaged, of course&mdash;but none of it would have been possible without the generosity of Cliff and Zoe.</p>
<p data-start="170" data-end="745">At the time, it felt like winning the lottery to have a two-bedroom apartment and a business in Noosa. Noosa Heads, the final resort on the Sunshine Coast where the river meets the ocean, has beautiful beaches and, when the winds are just right, great surfing conditions. On the north shore, ferries provide access for four-wheel drives to Fraser Island, the largest sand island in the Southern Hemisphere. The area is also surrounded by national parks with scenic walkways leading to other stunning beaches like Alexandria Bay&mdash;a well-known nudist beach&mdash;and Sunshine Beach.</p>
<p data-start="747" data-end="954">During my time there, I did most of my jogging and training through the national parks. I was one of the first runners to participate in the inaugural Noosa marathon&mdash;back then, there were only eight of us!</p>
<p data-start="956" data-end="1370">Being on-site managers during holiday periods was intense. We greeted guests, ensured they were comfortable during their stay, and cleaned up after they left, ready for the next holidaymakers. In those early days, there were defined seasons, with Christmas and Easter being the busiest times. In the winter, many of the apartment owners from the southern states would come to enjoy the warmer Queensland weather.</p>
<p data-start="1372" data-end="1838">This seasonal flow gave us a bit of respite, as the owners took care of their units. Our payment structure as on-site managers included a monthly wage from the body corporate, a percentage of the holiday lets, and cleaning fees charged to the owners after each rental. There were 12 apartments in total&mdash;six in each tower. We lived in one, and the property developer lived in the penthouse of the left tower, leaving 10 apartments available for holiday rentals.</p>
<p data-start="1840" data-end="2113">After a while, I realized it was too much for Sheila to handle all the cleaning on her own. I managed to convince Anna, Cliff and Zoe&rsquo;s daughter, to work alongside her. It was challenging, though&mdash;Sheila wouldn't speak to the guests or even answer the phone if I was busy.</p>
<p data-start="2115" data-end="2392">I couldn't dedicate all my time to cleaning, as I had responsibilities in the office, handling the business side of the management rights. We were audited two to three times a year, so everything had to be in order. It was a lot to manage, but we found a way to make it work.</p>
<p data-start="101" data-end="778">One day in the office, I received a phone call from Carolyn. The last time I had heard from her was when she was in Munich with Phillip. Phillip obtained his engineering degree in 1986, and like many young people after their studies, he decided to travel. He ended up in Munich, Germany, where he teamed up with two Australians who were manufacturing futon beds. They needed someone to deliver these futons to their customers, and Phillip saw an opportunity to make some cash while abroad. He started a transport business, delivering futons all over Europe. Within a year, he had two or three vehicles on the road, and it quickly became a very lucrative business for him.</p>
<p data-start="780" data-end="1318">Carolyn had worked with Phillip for a while, but she wanted more experience in the hospitality industry. To gain that experience, she went to Austria for the winter season, which is where she was calling me from. We had a great conversation, catching up on her experiences. Then she mentioned that she was planning to do a bicycle tour. That sounded incredible&mdash;I had always wanted to do something like that. We agreed to join each other in May for a bicycle tour. It was an exciting prospect, and I began looking forward to the adventure.</p>
<p data-start="210" data-end="364">We did the cycle ride, but not where we originally planned to go. However, it was a fantastic experience&mdash;I&rsquo;ll tell you more about it later.</p>
<p data-start="366" data-end="816">Back at Bali Hai, my decision to join Carolyn led me to purchase a bicycle. I ended up with a Cannondale mountain bike, and with this new toy, I began training. Noosa&rsquo;s national parks provided the perfect setting for it. That&rsquo;s where I met the bank manager of the then Metway Bank, an enthusiastic mountain bike rider. We started training together, and over time, we became good friends. Naturally, we both quizzed each other about our professions.</p>
<p data-start="818" data-end="1183">During one of these conversations, I learned more about his role at the bank. Seeing an opportunity, I soon approached him for advice on Bali Hai. After several weeks of discussions and negotiations, Bali Hai was finally ours, well partially. The bank had a big say in it, but Cliff and Zoe got their money, and we were all very happy. Or so I thought&hellip;</p>
<p data-start="129" data-end="500">It was a good life. As I mentioned before, there were definite seasons&mdash;times when we were incredibly busy, followed by periods when Noosa became very, very quiet. The Sunshine Coast Airport hadn&rsquo;t been built yet, so the only way to reach Noosa was by road. The Bruce Highway was the main route, and at the time, the Sunshine Coast Motorway was still under construction.</p>
<p data-start="502" data-end="766">The body corporate wage, combined with the income we made during the busy periods, provided a comfortable living, and the lifestyle was very pleasant. Cliff and Zoe had built a new home just a few blocks away, and we often enjoyed great coffee mornings together.</p>
<p data-start="768" data-end="1059">Cliff and I also had a regular tradition&mdash;we would go out to do the lotto together. Over time, we became a familiar pair at the local newsagent. With our shared sense of humor, we always managed to brighten the day of the shop owner, who would often say that seeing us come in made his day.</p>
As time went on, Sheila seemed to withdraw more into herself. It became increasingly difficult for me to say the right thing or to encourage her to go out and enjoy the company of others beyond just the two of us. No matter how much I tried, I couldn't spark her interest in taking a holiday.

Perhaps the workload was too much for her, or maybe there was something else weighing on her that I didn’t fully understand. We lived in a beautiful apartment with stunning views across Laguna Bay and were earning a fair living. I made sure we attended Sunday Mass and feast days, but despite all this, Sheila seemed unhappy and reluctant to socialize.

Some weekends were particularly busy, especially on the bright, sunny winter days when we had a full house. The steady flow of guests was great for business, helping to keep the cash flow healthy. Every now and then, visitors would ask, “Are you on the market to sell?” My usual response was a firm “No.” But some people wouldn’t take that for an answer. They would urge me to think about it, name a price, and let them know—often following up persistently.

This happened so many times that, sooner or later, I knew there would come a moment when it caught me at a low point—when I was feeling worn down, or perhaps when that familiar shadow of doubt, the ‘black dog,’ was lurking. And sure enough, one day, in a moment of frustration or uncertainty, I threw out a ridiculous price… and to my surprise, it was accepted.
