            <h2><h3 class="subtitle-section">The Bull dates back to the 1300's as a coaching inn offering respite to weary travellers along the Pilgrim's Way. An infamous haunt of smuggling gangs was the "Bull Inn." In 1799 a gang leader, Lieutenant Colonel Shadwell, was shot dead on 1st June by an army deserter, and his comrades wreaked a terrible revenge. The murderer and his comrade were savagely beaten to death by the smugglers, an event recorded on a stone set into the wall by the hotel. "With an eclectic past, including being the headquarters of a renowned gang of smugglers, as well as a favourite watering hole for Battle of Britain pilots, the 600 hundred year old Bull is now a beautiful four star country retreat as well as a gourmet dining destination with an AA rosette for culinary excellence.</h3></h2>

        <div class="content">
            <p>During my time in 1958, I embarked on a transformative journey within the vibrant hospitality industry. Following my seasonal stint aboard the Halladale, I found myself at a crossroads. Uncertain of my future in Dover and seeking a more enduring career path, I made the bold decision to pursue my passion for hospitality. In July of 1958, I took the leap and reached out to an agency, expressing my aspirations for a career in this dynamic field. Soon after, an opportunity emerged at the Bull Hotel, where I was warmly welcomed into the fold. As a waiter, I found myself under the tutelage of the esteemed head waiter, Alan Baines, whose jovial demeanor and wealth of experience enriched my journey. Under his guidance, I honed my skills in the art of service, mastering the intricacies of fine dining and customer care. He was quite a character. He had a way of making you feel at ease, even when the restaurant was bustling with activity. His attention to detail and dedication to his craft inspired me to strive for excellence in my own work. At the Bull Hotel, renowned for its culinary prowess, I embraced the intricacies of service, from assisting patrons with flair to learning the art of tableside cooking. The restaurant buzzed with activity, the ceilng in the the public is adorned with the signatures of valiant fighter pilots from World War II, a testament to the hotel's rich history. Among the eclectic clientele, one figure stood out Colonel Whintel, distinguished by his monocle and refined mannerisms. His presence added a touch of intrigue to our bustling establishment, as tales of his past escapades echoed through the halls. In the midst of culinary delights and memorable encounters, I found friendship among fellow staff members from the diligentcouple barmen to the dedicated housekeepers. The proprietors, Mr. and Mrs. Dixon, presided over the bustling establishment, their vision and dedication shaping the hotel's legacy. As I immersed myself in the vibrant tapestry of hospitality at the Bull Hotel, I discovered not only a career path but also a sense of belonging within a community driven by passion and friendship. Other employees were a couple of barmen one for the public and one for cocktail bar, couple of house keepers, and of course the kitchen staff. The owners were always about Mr Mrs Dixon and then were was another Mrs Dixon could not really find out where she fitted in the. One the housekeepers told she was the former wife of Mr Dixon!!!! After being there for a couple months they started to renovations to the hotel making the restaurant bigger and creating a lovely timber bar area. With the new extensions couple of new employees joined us. One of them was a young Irish girl to join me and Alan in the restaurant. we all worked well together the three of us were a good team in the restaurant. Till after one really busy weekend we get up for the breakfast shift on the Sunday morning only to be told that Alan had gone and taking all the monies + &amp; from the gratuities.<br>Sheila and I were getting on well with each other and spent our break times and eventually going out on our days off together. Sheila owned a Lambretta and we used this to get around the countryside. When would rode out me as a passenger on the back. But it did not take long before Sheila relinquished the driving and asked me to take over, we also spent many hours walking in the countryside. We had lots of outings and when the weather was not good we listened to radio Luxembourg which was the best radio station at that time.<br>While Sheila was older than me, we found ourselves engaging in conversations on various topics, discovering a compatibility in our opinions. One topic of discussion was my desire to move to Australia or New Zealand, which we both agreed would be an exciting opportunity. Throughout our conversations, it became evident to me that Sheila was a devout Catholic. This fact didn't concern me much, and I simply mentioned to Sheila that I was uncertain about my own beliefs, leaving the matter at that. I knew that eventually, we would need to have a more in-depth discussion about our differing beliefs.<br>Sheila lived in the hotel had lovely room which it was one of the guests room, my room was above the old stables the other guys were on the same floor. There was young cocktail barman in his twenties in the next room we got on well he was older than me and with it more experience of our work and of life. I suppose I was taken in by him and hung on his every word. He was talking of going to Spain to get some working experience at the time I said I would love to go with him. We made plans to do this.<br>Before I moved to the Bull hotel I had a suit made for me it was in the Italian style of the time, pale blue, I was very proud of it and felt grand when I was wearing. This barman I cannot remember his name, saw the suit hanging in my wardrobe then asked if he could try it on we were of the same build being naive I let him take it away to his room it was in the evening after service, thinking he will bring it back in the morning. You guessed it the next morning he was gone suit and all just walked out and left. Leaving me devastated losing my pride and joy and with a lesson learnt<br>As time passed, Alan was replaced by a young Italian head waiter named Joseph, who spoke English with an Italian accent and carried himself with confidence. With the completion of renovations in the cocktail bar and restaurant, we settled into a routine of providing meal service, though the trend of cooking at the table had diminished. During this period, the music and songs from the film/show My Fair Lady were immensely popular and played every night during food service. On our shared days off, Sheila and I arranged our schedules so we could spend three consecutive days together. This allowed us to visit our respective families; I would travel to Dover to see my mother, while Sheila would visit her father. We coordinated these trips with the consent of the management. During one of my visits home, upon returning to the Bull Hotel, I was informed by a housekeeper, who was aware of the close bond between Sheila and me, that something had happened to Sheila in my absence. She had informed Mr. Dixon of her decision to leave and was currently in her room, packing. Rushing to find her, I discovered Sheila in the lobby, awaiting her father to escort her home. It became clear to me that Joseph had taken advantage of her during my absence. On a couple of quiet nights, fueled perhaps by alcohol and the prevailing music of the time, Joseph had made inappropriate advances towards Sheila. Learning of this, I no longer felt comfortable staying at the Bull Hotel alone, especially with the prospect of continuing to work with Joseph. After discussing our options, Sheila and I decided to seek another live-in position elsewhere, using the services of the same agency we were familiar with. Sheila's father arrived, and after explaining our plans to him, he welcomed me to join them once I was free from my obligations at the Bull Hotel. He offered to transport Sheila's belongings, while she would follow him on their Lambretta. With the arrangements made, we bid farewell to the Bull Hotel, embarking on a new chapter in our lives.</p>
