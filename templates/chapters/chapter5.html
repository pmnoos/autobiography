        <div class="content">
            <p>After<a href="../../../media/images/wedding.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;Micheal &amp; Irene</a><a href="../../../static/images/wedding.jpg">&nbsp;</a>were married, they stayed on at Clare House for a few more months until they found somewhere to live, and then they moved out. Biddy continued to be a great help to my mother, providing much-needed support during a challenging time.<br>Then, one day, a new person arrived at Clare House. He was introduced to me as Eddie, the brother of one of my uncles, although I wasn't aware of our family connection at the time. Little did I know that he was soon going to become my stepfather, bringing significant changes to our lives. At that time, I lacked the business acumen and knowledge required to run a business, and I could sense that my mother must have been feeling overwhelmed, both emotionally and financially, since the loss of Dad.<br>Eddie's arrival seemed to offer a glimmer of hope and stability, and before long, he and my mother were married. As for us boys, Phillip and I were too young to fully comprehend the implications of the marriage. Meanwhile, Micheal, Lionel, and David were preoccupied with their own lives and responsibilities.<br>In the initial months following Eddie's arrival, things felt somewhat awkward. I wasn't sure what to say or how to interact, so I stuck to my usual routine. Each morning, around 7 o'clock, I'd make a trip to the local bakery, conveniently located just across the road in an area known as Winchelsea Rd. The bakery, nestled into the side of a hill, was a fascinating sight for a young boy like me. Stepping inside, I'd be greeted by the aroma of freshly baked bread and the sight of large mixers and ovens. Eagerly, I'd collect our order and hurry back home to clare House, enjoying the taste of a fresh crusty roll along the way.<br>This routine repeated itself three days a week, depending on how busy clare House was. Upon my return, Eddie would often be up and about, preparing tea for Mum and himself. We'd exchange greetings, and then I'd settle down to have some breakfast before heading off to school. The routine became familiar, and we all adjusted to our new dynamic.<br>However, our lives were soon to undergo another significant change with the news of Mum's pregnancy. Over the next three years, she brought four more children into the world: Tony, Carol, and twins Steven and Paul. While this undoubtedly brought joy and fulfillment to Eddie, for me, Phillip, and perhaps even Mum, it introduced a new set of challenges and adjustments. The dynamics of our family shifted once again, as we navigated the complexities of welcoming new siblings and adjusting to our evolving family structure<br>In time as Tony grew he joined Phillip and myself on our outings where would go for an outing the beach and spend a couple hours there. Tony would be in the push chair and I would Phillip walking beside some time I let him stand on the side of the push so he could ride giving him a rest times.<br>This particular day we were watching men working on some sea defenses it was all fenced off with wire fencing and we stood there on the outside of the fence and watched them going about there work. At the site there was a crane well inside of the fenced site it was what it looked to me anyway the crane started up and was manoeuvring into position when the iron hook on the end of the line swung round over the wire fence onto our side and whacked Phillip on the side of his head, it happened all to quickly to do anything to get out of the way.<br>The workmen stood in horror seeing just what had happened some of them rushed around to give some assistance. The side of Phillips head became a terrible sight enlarged and blue looking. The foreman I presumed he was the foreman got hold of Phillip and rushed him to the hospital. leaving me and Tony in a state of distress.<br>However one of the workmen got us into vehicle and drove us to the hospital where Phillip was it was good that the foreman got Phillip to the hospital quickly where placed ice packs on to bring swelling down they X rayed him, all was good no damage.<br>To this day I still have dreams about it, how Phillip looked with a big blue swelling on the side of his face. Of course I was interrogated by Mum as to how this could of happened. It was a few weeks before we could all get over it. Which Phillip did with no after effects.<br>As Tony grew older, it became increasingly evident that he faced challenges with normal childhood tasks. It became apparent that he would require special needs support as he continued to grow. Meanwhile, Carol blossomed into a lovely little girl, eager to assist our mother and Tony to the best of her abilities. However, managing the twins proved to be quite a handful.<br>Occasionally, guests would stay at clare House, requiring full board accommodation with breakfast, lunch, and dinner provided. Our mother, as always, was the mainstay in the kitchen. When Dad was alive, meal preparation was a collaborative effort between them, often turning into a friendly competition to see who could create the tastiest dish. Of course, Mum emerged victorious every time, but it added a fun element to the tasks.<br><br>However, after Dad's passing, it became evident that Eddie lacked culinary skills. Even serving the meals proved to be a challenge for him, as he had spent most of his life as a seaman and had little experience in the kitchen.<br>With Mum's pregnancy, there were times when she couldn't be in the kitchen at all. Recognizing this, Mum began teaching me some simple recipes that I could prepare during her absences to help manage the cooking duties. I did have Biddy around at times to assist me<br>Returning to the present, it was clear that Eddie lacked culinary skills. Despite his years spent at sea as a seaman, cooking and serving meals were foreign tasks to him. Nonetheless, he had to adapt and do his best to contribute to the household.<br>Unbeknown to me, this experience laid the foundation for a future career in hospitality. Academic pursuits held little appeal for me, especially as I witnessed the challenges at home.<br>It seemed that Eddie was grappling with alcoholism, likely exacerbated by the pressures of managing clare House. Despite this, he still had responsibilities beyond the business, with four children needing his attention.<br>Eddie often requested that I fetch him a bottle of gin from the pub or off-license, a task I used to fulfill without question. However, as his drinking habits became more apparent, I began to avoid his requests, preferring not to be around when he asked.<br><br>When my brothers learned about what was happening, they banded together to support our mother and attempted to remove Eddie from the picture. However, Mum adamantly refused to entertain the idea. As for me, I was in no position to take any action, so the matter was eventually set aside, and we continued with our lives.<br><br>The children were growing rapidly, with Carol increasingly assisting Mum. Tony received aid for his disabilities, while the twins continued to be a handful, lacking the firm guidance they needed from their father. Though I earned some respect from them, I didn't interact with them much. Phillip, on the other hand, spent most days with them.<br><br>In my final year at school, I still had to leave when Religious Education was taught, and instead this year, I attended music lessons. The previous year, it was art with Mr. Beaumont, a nice guy, but I struggled with art. The year before that was woodwork with Mr. Hayward, an elderly gentleman, but that was even more challenging for me. So, music it was for my last year, taught by Mr. Dickinson.<br>It was in this class that I met my best mate &amp; only friend I had made at this school, Sid King. I can't recall why he was in this class, but we bonded instantly, despite coming from different backgrounds - me from Folkestone Road and Sid from Clarendon Road.<br><br>Throughout the year, we were inseparable. After school, we'd often head to the cinema or occasionally take the bus to the Folkestone swimming pool. At some point, we both enrolled in The Big Brother Scheme to immigrate to Australia. Surprisingly, our parents gave us permission, perhaps eager to see us venture out on our own. We even went as far as having chest X-rays, and we both passed. However, after going through all the paperwork and preparations, Sid decided he didn't want to go through with it, and I certainly wasn't going to go alone.<br>Despite that, Sid and I remained great friends until we eventually lost contact when we both left to start our working lives.<br>As my birthday fell in February, I could leave school at the Easter break, which I did. In Dover during that period, the primary employment options were either working on the cross-channel ferries when they resumed for the summer season or in the coalmines, of which there were three not too far from Dover. However, working in the mines was definitely not something I had in mind. Instead, I decided to apply for a job on the cross-channel ferries, which started operating again at Easter. I was hired.</p>
