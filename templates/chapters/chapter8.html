 <hr>       
        <div class="content">
            <p dir="ltr">I arrived at the Red Lion cottage after tendering my resignation at the Bull Hotel. The Red Lion Cottages were situated just outside Slough, in the quaint village of Stoke Green. The village boasted a pub, the Red Lion, a corner store, and eight cottages lined up together, each detached with beautiful, extensive gardens in front. Vines adorned some cottages, adding a charming ambiance I appreciated even as a teenager. Sheila&rsquo;s father lived in number 6, a cottage with a manicured lawn that resembled those found on bowling greens, flawless level and vibrant green, not a weed in sight. Henry Kelly, Sheila&rsquo;s father, was a gardener by profession, tending to the grounds of the Sir Howard Vyse Estate just across the road from the cottages. The estate boasted a splendid array of old oak trees and sycamores, with a vegetable garden teeming with produce of every variety. Henry was among the dedicated gardeners responsible for nurturing the horticulture on the estate, and many of the cottages&rsquo; occupants were fellow employees. Inside, the cottages were modern for their age, with small back gardens featuring the flourishing bushes of Forsythia in full bloom. Each cottage comprised a kitchen, a living room, an upstairs bathroom, and two bedrooms, all decorated and cozy. Sheila greeted me upon my arrival just after midday; she had prepared a delightful lunch. Henry soon joined us, and over lunch, we shared stories of our experiences and aspirations. I found an instant connection with Henry; his warmth and positivity uplifted both of us. And so, another chapter of my life begins, alongside someone I cherish, hoping our affection is mutual.</p>
<p dir="ltr">After living closer together, I felt it was the right time to propose to Sheila. Sheila accepted immediately, and the news delighted Henry. However, a serious condition required consideration: Sheila desired a church wedding, and raised as a strict Catholic, she required my conversion to Catholicism.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I can&rsquo;t recall if I mentioned in earlier chapters, but my father was of the Jewish faith. However, we never attended a synagogue, nor was I brought up in the Jewish religion. I remember that in my early school days, when Religious Education (R.E.) classes occurred, teachers removed me from the classroom for other lessons, like art or music.</p>
<p dir="ltr">After careful consideration, I accepted the challenge, so to speak. At the Bull Hotel, Sheila discovered a nearby monastery that held Mass, and I accompanied her a few times, finding the experience quite interesting. I then attended religious instruction classes twice a week for two months before being baptised into the Catholic Church. I&rsquo;ve never regretted it, although I wouldn&rsquo;t call myself a religious person&mdash;far from it. Still, those Sunday homilies help keep you on the straight and narrow.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We were<a href="../../../../../media/gallery_images/Wedding_Day_0001_Edited.jpg"> married</a> on November 27th, 1959, at St. Ethelbert&rsquo;s Church in Slough. It was a small wedding with my brothers Michael (my best man), Lionel, and Phillip, along with my sister Carol, a bridesmaid. Henry was there, as well as Sheila&rsquo;s aunt and uncle, and another cousin named Sheila, who was also a bridesmaid. After the small reception, we set off for our honeymoon in Cornwall. Henry was kind and lent us his car for the trip.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This brings me to another little story worth mentioning.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I had been driving since I was fifteen, but always on a provisional license. Henry&rsquo;s generosity in lending us his car made me feel it was only right to get my full license. So, I booked my driving test. The day arrived, and after completing the course with the examiner, we sat in the car as he prepared to give me my results.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He looked at me and said, &ldquo;Have you done your National Service yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">I felt puzzled. &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll be a good thing when you do&mdash;they&rsquo;ll teach you the difference between left and right! I told you to turn left, and you turned right. I told you to turn right, and you turned left. But aside from that, I can&rsquo;t fault your driving. You&rsquo;ve passed.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><br>After taking some time for ourselves, it was time to seek employment. Our opportunity came as London Airport. We turned to the agency we had used before and found positions for both of us at London Airport, located not too far from Slough and accessible. London Airport comprised the Queens Building, which handled all domestic and continental flights, and London Airport North, a temporary facility until Heathrow Airport opened completely. The buildings at London Airport North were reminiscent of old wartime munition huts or buildings, with round roofs that sloped down to the ground like half-moons. Inside, there were lounges, restaurants, shops, and a cocktail bar. I found employment there, knowing it was temporary until they constructed proper facilities at Heathrow Airport. Back then, air travel was the exclusive domain of the elite: celebrities, politicians, and impeccably dressed business personnel. The seating areas offered an unrestricted view of the aircraft coming and going, including Constellations, Bristol Britannias, DC 9s, Boeing Stratocruisers, De Havilland Comets, and later, Boeing 707s. For me, seeing the well-dressed ladies with their lovely hats and gentlemen in their suits felt romantic. Working in the cocktail lounge, serving drinks, allowed me to engage in light conversation with the patrons, sparking my desire to travel. Sheila held a server position in the Queens Building cafeteria; I remained at London Airport North until its closure in 1959.<br>As the hands of time swept by, the depth of my feelings for Sheila grew stronger with each passing day. It was a realisation that led me to take a leap of faith and propose marriage.<br>To my delight, she accepted, and on the 26th of November 1959, we exchanged vows in a humble ceremony attended by only twenty cherished guests from each of our families.<br>Given Sheila&rsquo;s Catholic faith and her desire for our wedding to be celebrated in a Catholic church, I knew I would need to convert to Catholicism. Moving in with Sheila and Henry at Stoke Green, I completed a six- to eight-week instruction period with a Catholic priest, culminating in my baptism and formal entry into the Catholic Church. Growing up with no religious affiliation, I had always felt a vague sense of longing for some form of spiritual connection. In my youth, I had experimented with attending Sunday School gatherings, as well as trying out the Boys Brigade and Scouts, but I struggled to reconcile myself with the rituals and prayers involved. During our time working at the Bull Hotel, Sheila invited me to accompany her to Mass. Wanting to support her and strengthen our bond, I agreed. Near to the Bull Hotel was an old Friary Monastery at Aylesford, run by Carmelite friars. The monks, dressed in white cassocks, conducted the Mass in an austere chapel devoid of icons or plaques found in Catholic churches. These early morning Masses became a routine for us, offering me a glimpse into the Catholic faith. The instruction sessions were enlightening and engaging; I often engaged in-depth discussions with the Italian priest who oversaw my conversion. His perfect English, coupled with a charming Italian accent, left a lasting impression on me. Perhaps this experience sparked my love for Italian cuisine as I immersed myself in the culture.<br>While my time at the airport had been fulfilling, I knew it was time to spread my wings further. The hospitality industry, with its myriad facets, beckoned me to explore new horizons. Each establishment offered a unique tapestry of experiences, a canvas upon which I could paint the colours of my expertise and passion. As I contemplated the next chapter in my professional journey, I couldn&rsquo;t help but feel a sense of anticipation. What wonders awaited me in this ever-changing landscape of hospitality?<br>With Sheila still dedicated to her work at Pinewood Studios, the opportunity for us to embark on a new adventure presented itself as live-in positions at The White Swan Hotel in Stratford-upon-Avon for the summer. It was an offer too enticing to pass up, promising not only a change of scenery but also an opportunity to expand our repertoire in the realm of catering while bolstering our savings. We accepted the proposition, viewing it as a stepping stone towards our shared aspirations. Packing our bags, we prepared for the journey ahead. Thankfully, we still had the trusty Lambretta at our disposal, and with Henry&rsquo;s helping hand to load our belongings, we set off on the road to Stratford-upon-Avon. As the countryside rolled by, anticipation bubbled within us, mingling with a hint of nervous excitement. What adventures awaited us in this quaint town steeped in history and culture? Only time would reveal the treasures hidden within its cobblestone streets and timber-framed buildings. But one thing was certain: Sheila, and I were ready to embrace every moment of this new chapter in our lives.</p>
