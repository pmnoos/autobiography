            <h2><h2>Windsor</h2>
<p class="paragraph body-paragraph-tutorial">It&rsquo;s the largest and oldest inhabited castle in the world When William the Conqueror had Windsor Castle built in the late 11th century, it was to be an indestructible fortress. He built the castle to be strategically located on the Thames, while ensuring Norman dominance around London. At that moment, the royal family lived in the former palace of Edward the Confessor in the village of Old Windsor. Windsor Castle has been used as a royal residence in 1110 by Henry I (4th son of William the Conqueror). Since then, the castle has been the home of the British royal family, with no fewer than 39 monarchs residing there.</p></h2>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Without the Mini to travel, we had to look for employment closer to Stoke Green. We found work in Windsor, which was very close. We tried three places there. The first one was The Old House, a hotel right on the border of Windsor and Eton. From the hotel, you could see the comings and goings of the Eton students. The hotel restaurant was primarily visited by the parents of the Eton boys. It was very stuffy and posh with the Mater and Paters visiting their sons at Eton College. Unfortunately, we didn&rsquo;t stay long at The Old House. I don't think the existing staff took to me as they had always had waitresses there. One waitress, who thought she was in charge, tried ordering me around and upsetting me. When she saw it wasn't working, she went after Sheila, making our time there unbearable. We didn't need to put up with such nonsense, so we left after one month, telling management why and suggesting they do something about the said waitress. Sheila went to the Castle Hotel in Thames Street, and I went to The Grapes Restaurant in the same street. The new owners wanted to uplift the status of the premises and turn it into an upmarket dining experience. With my training at The Bull, experience cooking at the table, and working at the airport cocktail bar, how could these new owners refuse me?<br>Mr. and Mrs. Boyes, the new owners of The Grapes, were a great couple, but it soon became clear that this was their first foray into the catering business. Working at The Grapes was a real challenge due to its very small dining room, which had only about 10 to 12 tables. When you entered The Grapes from Thames Street, you first encountered a public bar. As you moved further in, you came across a lounge with a well-equipped cocktail bar. Climbing a set of stairs brought you to the dining area. The kitchen was located downstairs, and there was a lift that connected the kitchen to a pantry off the dining room. The kitchen was managed by a chef from Hungary, and communication with the kitchen was via speakers at each end. As you can imagine, service time presented obstacles, especially when trying to convey certain messages. The chef's understanding of requests and the crew's understanding of his accent often added to the challenge. At the side of the building, there were stairs leading down to the kitchen&mdash;stairs my patrons were unaware of. These stairs were a lifeline, allowing me to deliver the kind of service I aimed to establish in the newly opened Grapes fine dining room. As time went by, we managed to build a small following. Given The Grapes' location on Thames Street opposite Windsor Castle, we received many walk-ins during the summer season<br>Sheila stayed at The Castle Hotel for as long as she could, but once it became clear she was expecting, she reluctantly gave notice. They were sad to lose her and her lovely personality but wished her well for her upcoming confinement. Sheila quickly grew bored of staying at home and ended up joining me at The Grapes. She assisted in the pantry, out of sight of customers. We had a great time together and with the other employees, sharing many laughs. Eventually, the day came when Sheila could no longer work, but we were both thrilled with the anticipation of our child's arrival. We didn't know at the time, but our baby boy was on his way.What an amazing day that was for both of us and Henry! The anticipation had been building up for months, and finally, on January 27, 1961, our first child, Paul, arrived. The moment we saw him, all the anxiety and restlessness melted away, replaced by overwhelming love and joy. Holding Paul for the first time, we knew our lives had changed forever.<br>Sheila was radiant, despite the exhaustion, and Henry was beside himself with excitement. The room was filled with smiles and tears of happiness, and we couldn't stop marveling at the tiny new life we had brought into the world. The early days were a whirlwind of sleepless nights, diaper changes, and first smiles, but they were some of the best days of our lives.</p>
