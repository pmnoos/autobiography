            <h2><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>From Paddington to Redcliffe: A Tumultuous Journey &amp; The Hardest Decision: Drifting Apart Amid Promises and Betrayals</strong></p></h2>
        
 <hr>       
        <div class="content">
            <p>I have to talk about a part of my life that is very difficult to discuss. To tell you about it, I have to go back to when I started with Continental Agencies and was living in a gated complex in the western suburbs.<br>We arrived at the complex the day we moved out of the apartment we had sold in Paddington. We had thought we had secured a rental property in New Farm, a Brisbane city suburb. However, the day before we were due to move, we received a call from the agent informing us that we could not move into the New Farm apartment because the owners had not completed their purchase.<br>And so, we ended up at Bali Hai Jindalee&mdash;it was the only place we could find on short notice.<br>I have to say now that I did not want to sell the Paddington apartment. Cafe Mediterrano had sold&mdash;at a loss, I might add. At that time, I was not thinking straight, and Sheila was very upset with everything that had happened. After selling Cafe Mediterrano, I purchased a small catering business, The Diet Place. We worked on that for nearly a year before Continental Agencies bought it from me. This would have been 1999.<br>Continental Agencies had secured a contract with Woolworth&rsquo;s to manufacture fresh pizzas for all their stores in Queensland. As part of this expansion, they offered me the task of setting up a production line in the premises they had acquired from me.<br>Our first order was 700 pizzas, which was followed by continual increases until we eventually reached over 40,000 per week. The pizza manufacturing was running well, and the staff were well trained in production.<br>In 2001, Continental Agencies purchased Ronda Foods, and I was asked to become their production manager. I negotiated a better remuneration package, which was agreed upon, and I was given a fuel card along with a small pay rise.<br>During my first two years there, I developed the HACCP (Hazard Analysis &amp; Critical Control Point) manual and controls, which were required for all food manufacturing companies. Additionally, I had the factory certified for Halal. Then, in 2003, Continental Agencies sold Ronda Foods. I was kept on by the new owners as their production manager. However, when Ronda&rsquo;s was sold, Continental Agencies took away my fuel card, and the new owners refused to replace it. They showed no sympathy. Six months later, they sold the business again to a couple.<br>At first, these new owners were very pleasant, and we got along well. We introduced new products, and things seemed to be going well. Around this time, Continental Agencies also sold the Woolworth&rsquo;s pizza production to another company&mdash;along with the computer program I had designed to manage the production process. When they sold, I received nothing. All the hours I had spent creating that system amounted to nothing.<br>During all this time, Sheila was travelling to different places around Brisbane. One such place was Redcliffe, a seaside town on a peninsula about 40 kilometres from the city. She managed to talk me into visiting, and to my surprise, it was a lovely town&mdash;no high-rises, only a few apartment developments being built, and prices far cheaper than other Brisbane suburbs.<br>After seeing these apartments, we discussed the idea of living by the sea. We found one in Baywatch Marine Parade, Redcliffe, and I came up with a plan that I thought would benefit both Sheila and me, as well as my daughter and her husband. I offered them both a sum of money as a deposit to purchase the apartment. We had a rental agreement to pay them rent, and they could use the property as a negative gearing investment to assist with their taxes, as they were both on good salaries. They accepted the offer, and we moved into the apartment in December 2000.<br>In the following year, I became the body corporate secretary and started making acquaintances with other owners in the complex. We would often meet for morning coffee and drinks, which was great. However, Sheila refused to have anything to do with anyone and went out of her way to avoid them. This was difficult for me&mdash;it had been the same when we owned Bali Hai Noosa.<br>At the time of our agreement, my daughter and her husband owned a home in Forest Lake. He worked for Continental Agencies, and my daughter, I believe, worked at a bank.<br>Some time after our agreement, he told me he had secured a position in Sydney, which meant that he and the family would be moving. I was concerned, knowing this could affect our future in the apartment. I remember walking along the seaside in Redcliffe when he told me of his plans. He reassured me they would never sell Baywatch.<br>However, as their move approached, I asked whether they were planning to rent out their Forest Lake home. To my surprise, he said they were going to sell it but would be renting in Sydney. I warned him that selling their home was a big mistake, but my advice was ignored. Several years later, when they returned to Brisbane, they found house prices had increased significantly.<br>At this time, I was deeply involved with Ronda Foods and was overdue for some leave, having not taken a holiday in a couple of years due to the constant changes in ownership. It was agreed upon, so I finally booked a holiday for September 2005.<br>Then, at Easter 2005, my Daughter &amp; husband visited us at Baywatch and dropped the bombshell: they were going to sell the apartment, despite previously assuring us they never would.&nbsp;<br>They didn&rsquo;t consult us or explain their reasons. I even offered to pay more rent, but my offer was rejected.<br>I was devastated&mdash;I truly did not know what to do. We had been there for over four years, and while I was happy, Sheila continued her outings back to the city. I thought she was content, even though we did not socialise much.<br>Now comes the most difficult part of my story, but it must be told&mdash;even if it is only my side of what happened.<br>At Easter 2005, we also had a visitor from the UK staying with us for a couple of weeks. We had taken many day trips, showing off Brisbane and the surrounding countryside, and we all enjoyed each other&rsquo;s company. During one of our conversations, I mentioned I was due for a holiday and planned to visit the UK to see family. Our visitor kindly offered me accommodation if I was visiting.<br>I had always asked Sheila if she wanted to go on a holiday, but she had no interest. So, I told Sheila that I had booked leave from Ronda Foods for September. Meanwhile, the apartment was scheduled for auction in May. When Sheila and I discussed our next steps, her response floored me:<br>"We just have to move back to Brisbane."<br>Reflecting on it, in all our 40 years together and all the moves we made&mdash;were they for Sheila? Every decision, apart from moving to New Zealand, seemed to revolve around her needs. In the later years of our marriage, she started to withdraw. It became increasingly difficult to have conversations with her.<br>What hurt me the most was that I still loved her dearly and longed for a real connection one where we could laugh, share drinks, go out for a nice meal, or watch a show together. We had both worked hard all our lives and raised five wonderful children.&nbsp;<br>But the weight of everything caught up with me. The stress of running businesses, financial worries, and the pressure to always push forward had taken their toll. Depression lurked in the shadows, sometimes nipping at my heels, other times dragging me into the depths.<br>When I returned from my holiday, two or three days after returning to work, one of the owners joined me during my morning coffee break. His attitude toward me suddenly turned hostile. A simple conversation escalated into a heated exchange, and by the end of it, he had practically forced me to hand in my notice.<br>That was the final straw. After years of trying to do the right thing, everything had collapsed. I had lost so much.&nbsp;<br><br></p>
