        <div class="content">
            <p>In the mid-seventies, as the children grew older, I developed an interest in taking them to different restaurants. This was partly for my benefit, as I still had a strong inclination toward hospitality. In the earlier days, as I believe I&rsquo;ve mentioned in a previous chapter, we used to host full-on afternoon teas for family and friends. Taking the children to restaurants was, in part, a way for me to stay connected to the industry and keep up with trends. However, at that time, New Zealand had a limited selection of places to enjoy a good meal out.</p>
<p>&nbsp; That said, a few restaurants were starting to change the scene. One such place was a restaurant called Scoffers Inn, owned and operated by an English couple, Cliff and Zoe, who had fantastic ideas about how to run a restaurant with great menus and elegant d&eacute;cor. This was their second restaurant&mdash;the first, Nosh Inn, had equally creative charm, even in its name.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; After visiting Scoffers Inn several times, we became friendly with Cliff and Zoe. It was during one of these visits that they mentioned they were planning to sell the restaurant for personal reasons. Despite owning Magner Knitwear and having five children to care for, I seriously considered purchasing the restaurant. However, in their wisdom, they decided not to sell it to me. That&rsquo;s the kind of thoughtful people they were&mdash;they cared about my family and recognized the challenges we would face if we took on such a demanding business.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Later, in the early eighties, while we were still operating Magner Knitwear, we reconnected with Cliff and Zoe after they opened another beautifully designed restaurant called The Sussex. Eventually, we agreed to run The Sussex on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays for three months while they went overseas&mdash;a truly wonderful experience. Sheila took charge of making the desserts under Zoe&rsquo;s guidance, Julia and Phillip helped in the kitchen, and I managed the front of the house.</p>
<p data-start="1156" data-end="1391">You might think, <em data-start="1173" data-end="1389">"This guy has it made&mdash;he&rsquo;s been in New Zealand for just 15 years, owns a six-bedroom home with a swimming pool, and has raised five children. All he has to do is sit back, find some part-time work, and enjoy life."</em></p>
<p data-start="1393" data-end="1413">Well, think again.</p>
<p data-start="1415" data-end="1445">Life had other plans for me.</p>
<p data-start="1447" data-end="1654">After Magner Knitwear, I found myself on a <strong data-start="1490" data-end="1502">new path</strong>, one that led through three more businesses and three more homes. Each step brought fresh challenges, unexpected turns, and&mdash;sometimes&mdash;outright chaos.</p>
<p data-start="1447" data-end="1654">&nbsp;</p>
<p data-start="1656" data-end="1981">First, I bought a <strong data-start="1674" data-end="1697">property in Redvale</strong>, north of Auckland, with a <strong data-start="1725" data-end="1760">glasshouse for growing tomatoes</strong>.</p>
<h2 data-start="221" data-end="268"><strong data-start="224" data-end="266">Growing Glasshouse Tomatoes at Redvale</strong></h2>
<p data-start="270" data-end="539">I never gave much thought to growing tomatoes&mdash;especially <strong data-start="327" data-end="350">glasshouse tomatoes</strong>&mdash;until I found myself doing exactly that. I had no real experience in it, apart from what I learned from <strong data-start="455" data-end="464">Henry</strong>, who had helped plant tomato plants in the garden back at Gordon Avenue.</p>
<p data-start="541" data-end="848">The property had <strong data-start="558" data-end="585">two working glasshouses</strong>, with a third one still under construction. Our plan was to get the <strong data-start="654" data-end="678">two operational ones</strong> up and running for <strong data-start="698" data-end="724">full tomato production</strong>, which would take up all our time. We had no intention of hiring help&mdash;it was going to be just <strong data-start="819" data-end="845">us and the glasshouses</strong>.</p>
<p data-start="850" data-end="1141">At the time, the <strong data-start="867" data-end="893">glasshouses were empty</strong>, as the previous owner had just completed his growing season. They needed to be <strong data-start="974" data-end="1003">cleaned out and fumigated</strong> before we could plant a new crop. Typically, you could <strong data-start="1059" data-end="1087">harvest two crops a year</strong>, with the <strong data-start="1098" data-end="1113">winter crop</strong> being the most rewarding.</p>
<p data-start="1143" data-end="1357">Starting out, we had to be <strong data-start="1170" data-end="1202">careful with plant selection</strong>, as choosing the right variety was <strong data-start="1238" data-end="1249">crucial</strong>. We also had to ensure we had a <strong data-start="1282" data-end="1307">reliable water supply</strong> and <strong data-start="1312" data-end="1332">adequate heating</strong> for the winter months.</p>
<p data-start="1359" data-end="1587">Looking back, when I first saw the property, I had been more focused on the <strong data-start="1435" data-end="1457">house and location</strong> rather than the actual <strong data-start="1481" data-end="1519">practicalities of growing tomatoes</strong>. In hindsight, I probably should have asked a lot more questions.</p>
<h3 data-start="1589" data-end="1632"><strong data-start="1593" data-end="1630">A Lesson in Plumbing&mdash;The Hard Way</strong></h3>
<p data-start="1634" data-end="1740">While I was learning about tomatoes, I also learned a thing or two about <strong data-start="1707" data-end="1724">water systems</strong>&mdash;the hard way.</p>
<p data-start="1742" data-end="1974">At the time, we had <strong data-start="1762" data-end="1786">no town water supply</strong>&mdash;we relied completely on <strong data-start="1811" data-end="1824">rainwater</strong> collected from the roof and stored in a <strong data-start="1865" data-end="1890">huge round water tank</strong> beside the house. This single tank held all the <strong data-start="1939" data-end="1971">water we needed for the home</strong>.</p>
<p data-start="1976" data-end="2230">One day, I noticed a <strong data-start="1997" data-end="2011">small leak</strong> at the very <strong data-start="2024" data-end="2046">bottom of the tank</strong>. Water was slowly dripping from a tap. Thinking I could fix it, I grabbed my <strong data-start="2124" data-end="2149">brand-new red toolbox</strong>&mdash;which, at that point, hadn&rsquo;t seen much use&mdash;and pulled out a shiny <strong data-start="2216" data-end="2227">spanner</strong>.</p>
<p data-start="2232" data-end="2281">Now, you can probably guess what happened next.</p>
<p data-start="2283" data-end="2474">I gave the tap <strong data-start="2298" data-end="2316">one small turn</strong> with my spanner&mdash;and <em data-start="2337" data-end="2344">boom!</em> The <strong data-start="2349" data-end="2371">tap blew right off</strong>! A <strong data-start="2375" data-end="2399">huge deluge of water</strong> came rushing out, completely emptying the tank within <strong data-start="2454" data-end="2471">15&ndash;20 minutes</strong>.</p>
<p data-start="2476" data-end="2530">All I could do was shout, <em data-start="2502" data-end="2528">&ldquo;Someone get a plumber!&rdquo;</em></p>
<p data-start="2532" data-end="2751">Needless to say, I <strong data-start="2551" data-end="2590">wasn&rsquo;t the family&rsquo;s favorite person</strong> that day. We had to wait several days for a <strong data-start="2635" data-end="2653">water delivery</strong>, and in the meantime, everyone had to be extremely careful with whatever little water was left.</p>
<h3 data-start="2753" data-end="2778"><strong data-start="2757" data-end="2776">Life at Redvale</strong></h3>
<p data-start="2780" data-end="2974">At the time, <strong data-start="2793" data-end="2832">Paul and Kathryn were at university</strong>, Julia was working at a <strong data-start="2857" data-end="2865">bank</strong>, Phillip was finishing his <strong data-start="2893" data-end="2917">last year at Rosmini</strong>, and Carolyn was about to start at <strong data-start="2953" data-end="2971">Carmel College</strong>.</p>
<p data-start="2976" data-end="3263">Despite my plumbing disaster, we <strong data-start="3009" data-end="3044">did get the glasshouses planted</strong> and managed to grow <strong data-start="3065" data-end="3087">six or seven crops</strong> while we lived there. The <strong data-start="3114" data-end="3128">final crop</strong> was the best one we had&mdash;it was even considered <strong data-start="3176" data-end="3203">the top-quality produce</strong> at the <strong data-start="3211" data-end="3260">Auckland fruit and vegetable market that year</strong>.</p>
<p data-start="3265" data-end="3582">During our time at Redvale, we also <strong data-start="3301" data-end="3323">extended the house</strong> and built a <strong data-start="3336" data-end="3361">new farmhouse kitchen</strong>&mdash;a <strong data-start="3364" data-end="3390">large, welcoming space</strong> where the whole family could gather for meals. The <strong data-start="3442" data-end="3467">benches and cupboards</strong> were made of <strong data-start="3481" data-end="3497">Fijian Kauri</strong>, and it truly became <strong data-start="3519" data-end="3579">a wonderful place to cook, eat, and share family moments</strong>.</p>
<h3 data-start="3584" data-end="3623"><strong data-start="3588" data-end="3621">Moving On, But Not Forgetting</strong></h3>
<p data-start="3625" data-end="3855">After the <strong data-start="3635" data-end="3658">water tank disaster</strong>, it was suggested that&mdash;before I could do any more damage&mdash;I should look for a <strong data-start="3736" data-end="3753">part-time job</strong>. So, I got a job as a <strong data-start="3776" data-end="3805">knitting machine operator</strong> at a <strong data-start="3811" data-end="3852">knitwear clothing company in Auckland</strong>.</p>
<p data-start="3857" data-end="4109">Looking back, <strong data-start="3871" data-end="3882">Redvale</strong> wasn&rsquo;t just about <strong data-start="3901" data-end="3921">growing tomatoes</strong>&mdash;it was about the <strong data-start="3939" data-end="3987">memories, lessons, and family time we shared</strong>. There were so many <strong data-start="4008" data-end="4034">events and experiences</strong> there that I could probably write an entire <strong data-start="4079" data-end="4106">book just about Redvale</strong>.</p>
<p data-start="1656" data-end="1981">For three years, we worked the land, nurturing crop after crop while adjusting to country life. It was hard work, but it had its moments. (I could write a whole chapter on the <strong data-start="1938" data-end="1964">mishaps and adventures</strong> we had there.)</p>
<p data-start="1656" data-end="1981">And may I will.</p>
<p data-start="1983" data-end="2240">Then came <strong data-start="1993" data-end="2008">The Kitchen</strong>, a new business, followed by a home on Manuka Road in Glenfield.</p>
<hr data-start="114" data-end="117">
<h2 data-start="119" data-end="164"><strong data-start="122" data-end="162">From Redvale to the Kitchen Business</strong></h2>
<p data-start="166" data-end="440">Selling <strong data-start="174" data-end="185">Redvale</strong> turned out to be quite an experience. The property had been on the market for some time, but in the end, there were <strong data-start="302" data-end="324">two serious buyers</strong>. The real estate agent knew <strong data-start="353" data-end="381">exactly how to work them</strong>, playing them against each other in a <strong data-start="420" data-end="437">Dutch auction</strong>.</p>
<p data-start="442" data-end="651">Fortunately, we ended up getting a <strong data-start="477" data-end="508">good price for the property</strong>&mdash;even though we <strong data-start="524" data-end="563">never finished the third glasshouse</strong>. Looking back, I believe it was <strong data-start="596" data-end="622">the kitchen renovation</strong> that helped seal the deal.</p>
<h3 data-start="653" data-end="686"><strong data-start="657" data-end="684">A New Home in Glenfield</strong></h3>
<p data-start="688" data-end="1026">After selling Redvale, we found a <strong data-start="722" data-end="747">new home in Glenfield</strong>, still on <strong data-start="758" data-end="784">Auckland&rsquo;s North Shore</strong>. It was a <strong data-start="795" data-end="818">three-bedroom house</strong> with a <strong data-start="826" data-end="864">great dining room, a lovely lounge</strong>, and something truly special&mdash;<strong data-start="894" data-end="921">two giant Redwood trees</strong>. They reminded me of the ones in <strong data-start="955" data-end="969">California</strong>, and the house had a <strong data-start="991" data-end="1023">large deck built around them</strong>.</p>
<p data-start="1028" data-end="1352">The <strong data-start="1032" data-end="1047">back garden</strong> was equally impressive, with a <strong data-start="1079" data-end="1095">small stream</strong> running through it. Growing along the edges was <strong data-start="1144" data-end="1164">fresh watercress</strong>, perfect for <strong data-start="1178" data-end="1203">salads and sandwiches</strong>. The house itself sat on an <strong data-start="1232" data-end="1255">elevated brick base</strong>, which provided a <strong data-start="1274" data-end="1302">spacious downstairs area</strong>. It also came with a <strong data-start="1324" data-end="1349">large detached garage</strong>.</p>
<p data-start="1354" data-end="1457">We settled in quickly, but&mdash;as always&mdash;it wasn&rsquo;t long before I started <strong data-start="1423" data-end="1454">looking for something to do</strong>.</p>
<h3 data-start="1459" data-end="1494"><strong data-start="1463" data-end="1492">Starting Another Business</strong></h3>
<p data-start="1496" data-end="1830">Looking back now, I realize I had plans for <strong data-start="1540" data-end="1555">Manuka Road</strong> that I never followed through on. The property had <strong data-start="1607" data-end="1631">half an acre of land</strong>, split by the <strong data-start="1646" data-end="1656">stream</strong>, which would have been <strong data-start="1680" data-end="1710">perfect for a large garden</strong>&mdash;flowers, vegetables, the works. But instead of focusing on that, I found myself <strong data-start="1791" data-end="1827">on the hunt for another business</strong>.</p>
<p data-start="1832" data-end="1880">I&rsquo;ve never liked <strong data-start="1849" data-end="1877">working for someone else</strong>.</p>
<p data-start="1882" data-end="2148">That&rsquo;s when I came across <strong data-start="1908" data-end="1938">a small commercial kitchen</strong> for sale. It was in an <strong data-start="1962" data-end="1991">old butcher&rsquo;s corner shop</strong>, complete with a <strong data-start="2009" data-end="2060">large bank of freezers, stainless steel benches</strong>, and a <strong data-start="2068" data-end="2115">designated area for an oven and dishwashing</strong>. It was the <strong data-start="2128" data-end="2145">perfect setup</strong>.</p>
<p data-start="2150" data-end="2447">We started producing <strong data-start="2171" data-end="2225">desserts, quiches, cheesecakes, cakes, and muffins</strong>, supplying them to <strong data-start="2245" data-end="2309">delis, pubs, hospitals, and restaurants across Auckland City</strong>. I <strong data-start="2313" data-end="2337">loved the creativity</strong> of it all&mdash;experimenting with recipes, making delicious products, and seeing them enjoyed by so many people.</p>
<h3 data-start="2449" data-end="2485"><strong data-start="2453" data-end="2483">Another One Bites the Dust</strong></h3>
<p data-start="2487" data-end="2572">I can&rsquo;t recall exactly how long we ran the business, but I do remember enjoying it.</p>
<p data-start="2574" data-end="2723">Then, one day, someone <strong data-start="2597" data-end="2625">walked in off the street</strong>, saw what we were doing, and <strong data-start="2655" data-end="2667">loved it</strong>. They made an <strong data-start="2682" data-end="2703">offer on the spot</strong>, and we accepted.</p>
<p data-start="2725" data-end="2773">Just like that&mdash;<strong data-start="2740" data-end="2771">another one bites the dust.</strong></p>
<p data-start="1983" data-end="2240">From there, I jumped into the <strong data-start="2104" data-end="2127">restaurant industry</strong> with the purchase of a <strong data-start="2151" data-end="2171">pizza restaurant, The El Greco</strong> , moving our home once again&mdash;this time to Onewa Road in Birkenhead.</p>
<hr data-start="94" data-end="97">
<h2 data-start="99" data-end="137"><strong data-start="102" data-end="135">El Greco &ndash; A Slice of Success</strong></h2>
<p data-start="139" data-end="312">El Greco was a <strong data-start="154" data-end="179">great little business</strong>. Our main trade was <strong data-start="200" data-end="230">takeaway pastas and pizzas</strong>, with a small <strong data-start="245" data-end="260">dining room</strong> that could accommodate <strong data-start="284" data-end="309">a dozen or so patrons</strong>.</p>
<p data-start="314" data-end="599">We bought the pizza shop from <strong data-start="344" data-end="362">two Greek guys</strong>, who insisted&mdash;<strong data-start="377" data-end="399">quite emphatically</strong>&mdash;that the <strong data-start="409" data-end="453">Greeks, not the Italians, invented pizza</strong>. We didn&rsquo;t argue with them. Their <strong data-start="488" data-end="514">recipes and procedures</strong> were already well established, and to be fair, they <strong data-start="567" data-end="596">knew what they were doing</strong>.</p>
<p data-start="601" data-end="745">At the time, <strong data-start="614" data-end="653">food delivery services didn&rsquo;t exist</strong>. If people wanted a pizza, they had to <strong data-start="693" data-end="742">call in their order and pick it up themselves</strong>.</p>
<h3 data-start="747" data-end="777"><strong data-start="751" data-end="775">Running the Business</strong></h3>
<p data-start="779" data-end="1002">Our workday started around <strong data-start="806" data-end="815">10 AM</strong>, prepping everything for the night ahead. Sheila and I would spend the <strong data-start="887" data-end="919">mornings in the back kitchen</strong>, while we had a young man named <strong data-start="952" data-end="959">Ken</strong> handling prep in the <strong data-start="981" data-end="999">front of house</strong>.</p>
<p data-start="1004" data-end="1183">Ken was <strong data-start="1012" data-end="1027">a great lad</strong>&mdash;tall, handsome, with a <strong data-start="1051" data-end="1078">head full of curly hair</strong>. At just <strong data-start="1088" data-end="1110">nineteen or twenty</strong>, he was already a <strong data-start="1129" data-end="1150">true professional</strong> when it came to making pizzas.</p>
<p data-start="1185" data-end="1588">The <strong data-start="1189" data-end="1211">pizza dough recipe</strong> was the heart of the business, and Ken had perfected the <strong data-start="1269" data-end="1291">art of handling it</strong>. He taught me a lot&mdash;how to <strong data-start="1319" data-end="1357">work the dough, shape it properly,</strong> and <strong data-start="1362" data-end="1386">get the best results</strong>. During service, he&rsquo;d <strong data-start="1409" data-end="1445">toss the dough high into the air</strong>, much to the delight of our customers. It became part of the <strong data-start="1507" data-end="1530">El Greco experience</strong>, turning a simple wait for food into <strong data-start="1568" data-end="1585">entertainment</strong>.</p>
<p data-start="1590" data-end="1738">We were even <strong data-start="1603" data-end="1624">regularly visited</strong> by players from the <strong data-start="1645" data-end="1671">New Zealand All Blacks</strong>, who came in for a <strong data-start="1691" data-end="1735">good feed of carbohydrates before a game</strong>.</p>
<p data-start="1740" data-end="1800">The menu was <strong data-start="1753" data-end="1778">simple but well-loved</strong>. <em data-start="1780" data-end="1798">(See menu link.)</em></p>
<h3 data-start="1802" data-end="1839"><strong data-start="1806" data-end="1837">A New Home &amp; A New Question</strong></h3>
<p data-start="1841" data-end="2077">As the business grew, we decided to <strong data-start="1877" data-end="1904">move closer to the shop</strong>. We found a <strong data-start="1917" data-end="1951">modern three-bedroom townhouse</strong>, with <strong data-start="1958" data-end="1972">city views</strong>, an <strong data-start="1977" data-end="1998">integrated garage</strong>, and a <strong data-start="2006" data-end="2041">master bedroom with an en suite</strong>&mdash;all spread over <strong data-start="2058" data-end="2074">three levels</strong>.</p>
<p data-start="2079" data-end="2095">At this point:</p>
<ul data-start="2096" data-end="2302">
<li data-start="2096" data-end="2143"><strong data-start="2098" data-end="2118">Paul and Kathryn</strong> were at <strong data-start="2127" data-end="2141">university</strong></li>
<li data-start="2144" data-end="2191"><strong data-start="2146" data-end="2167">Julia and Phillip</strong> had <strong data-start="2172" data-end="2189">gone overseas</strong></li>
<li data-start="2192" data-end="2249"><strong data-start="2194" data-end="2247">Phillip had just completed his Engineering degree</strong></li>
<li data-start="2250" data-end="2302">At home, it was just <strong data-start="2273" data-end="2300">Sheila, Carolyn, and me</strong></li>
</ul>
<p data-start="2304" data-end="2382"><strong data-start="2304" data-end="2347">Business was going well. Life was good.</strong> I thought we were all <strong data-start="2370" data-end="2379">happy</strong>.</p>
<p data-start="2384" data-end="2425">Then, out of the blue, Sheila asked me:</p>
<p data-start="2427" data-end="2483"><strong data-start="2427" data-end="2481">"Have you ever thought about living in Australia?"</strong></p>
<p data-start="2485" data-end="2611">I was caught off guard. I had always talked about taking a <strong data-start="2544" data-end="2564">holiday overseas</strong>, but moving? That was a <strong data-start="2589" data-end="2608">different story</strong>.</p>
<p data-start="2613" data-end="2664"><em data-start="2613" data-end="2653">"Where in Australia are you thinking?"</em> I asked.</p>
<p data-start="2666" data-end="2683"><strong data-start="2666" data-end="2681">"Brisbane."</strong></p>
<p data-start="2685" data-end="2715">That surprised me even more.</p>
<p data-start="2717" data-end="2761"><em data-start="2717" data-end="2759">"Brisbane? But you&rsquo;ve never been there."</em></p>
<p data-start="2763" data-end="2921">I knew Brisbane in the early 80s&mdash;it was&nbsp;<strong data-start="2804" data-end="2839">hot, humid, and far from modern</strong>. It wasn&rsquo;t like <strong data-start="2856" data-end="2879">Sydney or Melbourne</strong>. It was still <strong data-start="2894" data-end="2918">growing up as a city</strong>.</p>
<p data-start="2923" data-end="2993">But now that the idea had been spoken aloud, it couldn&rsquo;t be ignored.</p>
<p data-start="2995" data-end="3049">And to my surprise&mdash;<strong data-start="3014" data-end="3047">Carolyn was on Sheila&rsquo;s side.</strong></p>
<p data-start="2242" data-end="2351">Looking back, I sometimes wonder: <em data-start="2276" data-end="2349">Was I searching for success? Or was I simply chasing something unknown?</em></p>
<p data-start="2353" data-end="2426">And then, my journey took an even bigger leap&mdash;I moved to <strong data-start="2410" data-end="2423">Australia</strong>.</p>
<p data-start="2428" data-end="2527">Australia became a fresh start, an entirely <strong data-start="2472" data-end="2487">new chapter</strong> filled with unexpected opportunities.</p>
<p data-start="2529" data-end="2794">👉 <strong data-start="2532" data-end="2600">At the Britannia Inn during World Expo 1988, I worked as a chef.</strong><br data-start="2600" data-end="2603">👉 <strong data-start="2606" data-end="2682">I owned and operated a Silvio&rsquo;s Pizza franchise (now known as Domino&rsquo;s).</strong><br data-start="2682" data-end="2685">👉 <strong data-start="2688" data-end="2733">I opened my own restaurant, Robin&rsquo;s Nest.</strong><br data-start="2733" data-end="2736">👉 <strong data-start="2739" data-end="2792">I moved to Noosa and reunited with Cliff and Zoe.</strong></p>
<p data-start="2796" data-end="2980">It was through Cliff that I had the chance to buy <strong data-start="2846" data-end="2869">Bali Hai Apartments</strong>, followed by the <strong data-start="2887" data-end="2912">Palm Grove Restaurant</strong>, which I renovated and turned into <strong data-start="2948" data-end="2977">Cheers Italian Restaurant</strong>.</p>
<p data-start="2982" data-end="3018">But the journey didn&rsquo;t stop there.</p>
<p data-start="3020" data-end="3390">👉 <strong data-start="3023" data-end="3100">I returned to Brisbane and partnered with Cliff to open Caf&eacute; Mediterrano.</strong><br data-start="3100" data-end="3103">👉 <strong data-start="3106" data-end="3178">I launched The Diet Place, later selling it to Continental Agencies.</strong><br data-start="3178" data-end="3181">👉 <strong data-start="3184" data-end="3287">At Continental, I became a Production Manager, overseeing fresh pizza manufacturing for Woolworths.</strong><br data-start="3287" data-end="3290">👉 <strong data-start="3293" data-end="3388">Then, when Continental acquired Rhonda Foods, I transitioned into managing p&acirc;t&eacute; production.</strong></p>
<p data-start="3392" data-end="3509">For the life of me, I can&rsquo;t fully explain <strong data-start="3434" data-end="3441">why</strong> I&rsquo;ve never settled. Maybe it&rsquo;s ambition. Maybe it&rsquo;s restlessness.</p>
<p data-start="3511" data-end="3611">But one thing is certain&mdash;each venture, each challenge, and each move shaped the person I am today.</p>
<p data-start="3613" data-end="3646">And the story is far from over.</p>
