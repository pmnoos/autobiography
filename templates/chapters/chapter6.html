            <h2><h3 class="subtitle-section">The beginning of my working life marked a significant transition, filled with uncertainty about what lay ahead and where this journey would ultimately take me.</h3></h2>
        
 <hr>       
        <div class="content">
            <p>When the time came for us to part ways, realizing that neither Sid nor I would be going to Australia, I found myself at a loss regarding what to do next. Syd faced a similar uncertainty; his father worked in the mines, but Syd was adamant about not following in his footsteps. I can't recall if Syd left school at the same time as me.</p>
<p>And so, without any formal send-off, I bid farewell to school.</p>
<p>&nbsp;However, the options available to me in the 1950s were incredibly limited. I wasn't academically inclined, so pursuing further education wasn't a viable path. Moreover, employment opportunities in Dover, only five years after the war, were practically nonexistent.<br>The only immediate option seemed to be the cross-channel ferries, which were gearing up for their summer season. However, this line of work meant being stuck in a cycle of seasonal employment, working only six months out of the year. The alternative was staying put at clare House, but with Eddie's behavior worsening, particularly due to the twins' antics, that wasn't a feasible option. Therefore, the logical choice was to embark on a season with the ferries, gaining some work experience and, hopefully, saving up some money. Then, after the six-month stint, I could start exploring opportunities beyond Dover.With that plan in mind I would still be in a position to help and assist Mum where I can also keep an eye out for Phillip, Tony, and Carol<br><br>Nearly all of the shipping, including ferries, docks at two locations in Dover Harbour: the Eastern Arm Docks and the Western Arm Docks. At the Eastern Arm, the ships primarily carry vehicles and passengers, while the Western Arm Docks cater mainly to walk-on passengers and other vessels that transport trains across the channel. One such train is the famous&nbsp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Arrow_(train)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Golden Arrow</a>, which departs from London Victoria, boards the ferry, and continues its journey to Paris, France. The Western Docks operate year-round, whereas the Eastern Arm Docks were seasonal until the early 1960s when they began operating year-round.<br>So on the 30th of March 1955, I went through the formalities of registering as a seaman. (Well, as a Pantry Boy, you have to start somewhere.) In fact, I had joined the Merchant Navy. At the time, it didn't occur to me that I would essentially be part of the Navy, albeit not the Royal Navy. Regardless, I was now a part of an organization at just fifteen years old. The experience was a mix of excitement and fear. In the registration office, I was surrounded by seasoned sailors signing up for the same ship, making me feel like nothing more than a boy amidst men<br>With the 1955 season starting , and I have signed articles as a Pantry Boy I can now join as part of the crew on a vessel named&nbsp;<a href="../../../static/images/halladale.jpeg">TSS Halladale</a>&nbsp;, a converted naval frigate. This vessel was designed to accommodate and transport passengers and their vehicles across the English Channel, featuring a roll-on, roll-off conversation system.<br>As dawn broke, we gathered at the&nbsp;<a href="../../../static/images/ramps.jpg">Eastern Docks</a>, awaiting the arrival of the ship freshly refitted for the summer season. With precision, it backed in, aligning the stern for the ramp's descent, welcoming us aboard.<br>A diverse mix of personnel streamed onto the ship. Some wore uniforms, likely officers, while others, sporting sailors' hats and sturdy jeans, assumed the roles of deckhands. Then there were those, like myself, dressed casually, presumably part of the catering team.<br>Navigating the ship seemed daunting for those of us in civilian attire until a friendly face introduced himself as the Second Steward, guiding us to the restaurant area. Following his lead, we embarked on a quick tour of the decks, familiarizing ourselves with our workspaces. Amidst the group, I noticed I was likely the youngest, surrounded by seasoned men engaged in conversation and introductions.<br>Once settled, assignments were distributed, along with the areas each of us was tasked with keeping spotless. Quickly, I learned the term "scrubout" - my domain being the toilets. Alongside me was Les Aston, who swiftly became a trusted friend, imparting invaluable lessons on seafaring work ethics.<br>As a recent school leaver, stepping into my role as a Pantry boy aboard the ship marked the beginning of a journey into the world of maritime service. In those initial days, our focus was on preparing the vessel for the upcoming summer season of sailings, despite its recent refit.<br>The interior of the ship demanded our attention, requiring thorough cleaning and the meticulous arrangement of furniture to ensure the comfort of our passengers. On the main deck, a bustling array of amenities awaited, from the inviting allure of the Bar and the allure of the Duty-Free shop to the culinary delights of the Buffet and Restaurant. Below deck lay the essential facilities of bathrooms and toilets, vital for the convenience of all on board. However, our duties extended beyond mere cleanliness. As the ship prepared for its voyages, stocking up on provisions was paramount. The Duty-Free shop, in particular, demanded careful attention, with its array of bonded goods requiring meticulous handling. I vividly recall the formalities surrounding the arrival of cigarettes, spirits, and liquor, each carton subject to scrutiny by a customs agent before being secured below deck.<br>The process of stocking up was a well-choreographed routine, with the crew forming a line to transport the goods from the delivery point to their designated storage area. Each crew member played a vital role, passing the cargo along until it reached its final destination. This ritual would be repeated countless times throughout the summer season, a testament to the meticulous preparation required for each voyage. Amidst the hustle and bustle of provisioning, there were moments of quiet reflection as well. As passengers embarked and disembarked, I found myself returning repeatedly to my designated "scrubout" areas, under the watchful eye of seasoned crew members. It was a period of intense learning, with each repetition honing my skills until my work met the exacting standards of cleanliness expected at sea.<br>During the crossings, my days were predominantly spent in the pantry, where the steady rhythm of washing up became second nature. It was a role that demanded diligence and attention to detail, qualities I endeavored to cultivate as I embraced my responsibilities on board. In retrospect, those early days were filled with challenges and opportunities for growth, laying the foundation for the adventures that lay ahead on the open sea.<br>Continuing on, I spent two more summer seasons on board, being laid off each winter. During those winters, I found employment in various hotels. It wasn't until 1956, when I came of age to drive, that I managed to acquire an old second-hand car. Around that time, the conflict known as the Seven-Day War erupted between Egypt and Israel. Despite the turmoil, I pursued diving lessons and obtained a provisional driving license. Interestingly, due to the war, I was granted the privilege to drive without supervision. This newfound freedom allowed me to seek live-in jobs outside of Dover until the next summer season, a routine I maintained for the following three years.<br>In May 1957, however, I seized a different opportunity. Hearing that another ship was desperately short of Assistant Stewards, I decided to apply, aiming to elevate my rating from Pantry boy. Despite being just 17, a year shy of the official requirement for the role, the shortage of crew members worked in my favor. They signed me up and stamped my discharge book, granting me an adult rate of pay. After a couple of months in this new role, I returned to Dover with my upgraded rating. There, I joined the SS Dinnard as an Assistant Steward, remaining with the ship until November 1957. Subsequently, I returned to the Halladale, where I stayed until late 1958.<br>During one of my winter layoffs, I found myself seeking employment in hotels through a specialized catering employment agency. On my first assignment with the agency, they sent me to the Casino Hotel on Taggs Island, Hampton Court, London, where they were in need of a commie-barman.<br>Armed with my car and the ability to drive, I packed my meager belongings and embarked on the journey to London, a little over two hours away. Arriving at<a href="../../../media/images/taggs-island.jpg">&nbsp;Taggs Island </a>, I was struck by its unique setting with a small bridge spanning the Thames led to the island, entirely occupied by the hotel, with houseboats moored all around. After a brief interview with the resident cocktail barman, during which we discussed my duties and I was outfitted with the hotel's uniform, I was shown to my living quarters a houseboat moored nearby. As I changed into the uniform, the barman returned to his post, and it was already mid-afternoon.<br>The cocktail bar itself resembled those seen in movies, with a mirrored backdrop showcasing an array of glassware and spirits from around the world. Although I recognized some, many were unfamiliar, and I knew I had much to learn. The oval-shaped bar was surrounded by stools, awaiting the arrival of patrons. Feeling somewhat professional, thanks to my experience in a pub, albeit on a smaller scale, I was left to begin my tasks while the barman went for his lunch. With cleaning being my second nature, given my previous experience cleaning ship toilets, I tackled the task in stages, starting with the back mirrors.<br>However, my concentration was soon interrupted by the arrival of two customers a young couple with distinctly posh accents. Attempting to remain composed, I greeted them and inquired how I could assist. Their order a pair of brandy Alexanders left me momentarily flustered, but I assured them it was my first day and set about gathering the ingredients.<br>Unfortunately, my attempt at shaking the cocktail went awry when I forgot to secure the lid on the shaker, resulting in a messy splatter of brandy, creme de cacao, and cream across the freshly cleaned back mirror. Despite their initial disappointment, the couple found humor in the situation, and we shared a laugh at my expense until the barman returned, his expression a mixture of shock and amusement at the sight before him.<br><a title="Taggs Island" href="static/images/taggs.jpg">Taggs Island</a> indeed marked the beginning of my journey as a commie-barman, a role filled with both challenges and rewards. However, as winter settled in and the chill of the nights grew sharper, the discomfort of sleeping on the houseboat became increasingly unbearable. Despite my appeals for additional bedding being met with denial and an indifferent response to my discomfort, I made the difficult decision to depart, packing my belongings and leaving on Christmas day. Shortly after, I joined the crew of the SS Dinnard, where I encountered Charlie Byrom, another steward. Charlie took me under his wing, showing kindness and mentorship. He became not just a colleague, but a friend, and I fondly recall the valuable lessons he imparted about the steward's role. It was a memorable experience aboard the SS Dinnard, and Charlie's invitation to spend Christmas with his family in Sittingbourne added to the warmth of the season. With that invitation in mind, I found the courage to bid farewell to Taggs Island, knowing there was another place where I belonged.</p>
