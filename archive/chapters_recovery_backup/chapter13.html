<h3 class="subtitle-section">SS America was sold to Chandris Lines on October 5, 1964, and was handed over 12 days later when she was transformed externally with her funnels pained blue emblazoned with the famed Chandris large white X. On the same day the America was renamed Australis. With the Greek flag flying from her stern, she departed New York on November 18, to the Chandris Shipyards at Piraeus to be converted to a liner for the UK to Australia and New Zealand service. Her accommodations were substantially increased now accommodating 2258 passengers in an all Tourist Class configuration. In addition both Upper and Main Decks were extended aft, replacing several Tourist Class lounges with cabins. In addition her hull was pained white with a blue ribbon</h3></h2>

            <p>Receiving the letter from Sitmar Travel Agency in July 1966 was a pivotal moment for us. The offer of berths for our entire family on the SS Australis departing from Southampton on January 26th, 1967, was the opportunity we had been waiting for. Without hesitation, we accepted the offer and immediately began putting arrangements in place to prepare for our departure. Firstly, we set the wheels in motion to sell our house, ensuring that everything would be in order by the time of our departure. We also gave notice to Townsend Ferries, making arrangements for our departure from my current employment. And of course, we shared the exciting news with our family, preparing them for our upcoming journey. With everything falling into place, our anticipation and excitement for the adventure ahead grew with each passing day. We were ready to embark on this new chapter of our lives and embrace the opportunities that awaited us in New Zealand.<br><br>The day before our departure from the UK we stayed at our mother. In the afternoon I went down to the Dover Priory Railway station to confirm the times and to pay for the train journey to Southampton we need to arrive at Southampton no later than 4:30pm. I booked a taxi for morning trip to the station for all &amp; luggage in time for the train to London. Having completed this task we went home to spend the last hours with our family. In the morning there were very mixed emotions when saying our good byes. The children were seemed confused as normally they did not get this much attention! Maybe Paul was more switched on to it anyway it was very emotional. We arrived at the station on time for the train to London Charing Cross where we would get the connection to Southampton to arrive on time.<br>However when we all arrived with lots of luggage in informed the porter what we are doing he replied well this train is going to London but Cannon Street not Charing Cross. You can imagine how I felt this first stage of immigrating NZ. I was livid that I was told misinformation and paid for all us to Southampton. Anyway the station master was very apolegetic he sorted the times out and will have a taxi waiting for us to get us to Charing Cross in time for the connection to Southampton.<br>On our journey to Cannon Street, at each stop, a British Rail employee would find us on the train to reassure us that the taxi would be waiting to take us to Charing Cross station. Thanks to their assistance, we made it to Southampton on time for boarding the ship.<br>As we walked up the gangplank, an officer greeted us, asked for our names, found us on his list, and gave us our cabin number. He informed us that a crew member would show us the way to our cabin. The crew member who assisted us spoke little English, and from his attempts to communicate, I gathered that it was his first day on the Australis. In fact, it was the first day for most of the crew.<br>We later learned that the Chandris Company had changed the registration of the Australis to Panama. Previously, it was registered in Piraeus, Greece, and as a result of the change, all the Greek crew had walked off the ship, refusing to sail under a Panama flag. This explained why so many of the crew were new and still finding their way around.<br>We found our cabin, which was quite roomy, complete with a bathroom and toilet. Our bags arrived, but we decided to leave them unpacked for the moment. Instead, we headed to the upper deck where everyone was gathering for our departure. Colored streamers fluttered in the wind, and a band played music that we couldn't quite make out. Everyone on the ship was waving and shouting messages to people on the shore, who were doing the same in return. It was a thought-provoking moment&mdash;we were now on the ship we had been waiting for all these years, about to embark on a long journey from the UK. It hit me that we were leaving our family behind, not knowing when we would see them again. I felt the weight of responsibility for Sheila and our four children, hoping I had made the right decision for all of them. With the excitement of the departure behind us, we explored the ship and talked to the children, reassuring them and explaining what was happening. As we walked around, I spotted the young lady from the travel agency where we bought our tickets. She had been offered a berth to Piraeus to gain firsthand knowledge of the Australis to better sell future voyages. Seeing her on the ship gave me a sense of reassurance that I had made the right decision, although I could not quite explain why. Despite this comforting encounter, I never talked to Sheila about my feelings. Instead, I kept my thoughts to myself, focusing on ensuring our family settled in and adjusting to our new life at sea.<br>From Piraeus, we sailed through the Suez Canal, one of the last ships to pass through before the war between Israel and Egypt. Our next destination was Fremantle, the port for Perth, Australia, a journey that took about three weeks at sea. After Fremantle, we headed to Melbourne and then to Sydney, stopping at each port for a couple of days. Leaving Sydney, we crossed the Tasman Sea to Auckland, New Zealand, a crossing that took nearly five days. We finally disembarked on the 6th of March, 1967. The journey itself was long but filled with anticipation. The passage through the Suez Canal was particularly significant, given the geopolitical tensions at the time. Each port we visited offered a brief respite and a glimpse into the diverse landscapes and cultures of Australia. Fremantle was our first taste of Australian soil, and the sense of reaching a new continent was both thrilling and surreal. Melbourne's vibrant cityscape and Sydney's iconic harbor left lasting impressions, but it was the crossing of the Tasman Sea that truly tested our patience and resilience. As we neared Auckland, the excitement within our family was palpable. We had finally arrived in the country that would become our new home. The date, 6th March 1967, is etched in my memory as the beginning of a new chapter in our lives. Despite the uncertainties and challenges ahead, stepping off the ship in Auckland felt like a moment of triumph and hope for the future.<br>After going through the immigration formalities, we were welcomed to New Zealand by a person with whom I had been in touch through a friend of a friend. He had kindly arranged to meet us and transport us to a rental house that he had secured for us. All these arrangements were made through correspondence over the preceding months. His warm welcome and assistance made the transition smoother and reassured us that we had support in our new home.</p>
