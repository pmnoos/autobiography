        <div class="content">
            <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;&nbsp;Cliff wanted to find employment for his son and suggested we take a trip down to Brisbane to explore opportunities that could provide all of us with jobs and a worthwhile investment. The idea for the Caxton Street restaurant was that Cliff would buy the building, while I would purchase and run the restaurant. I would pay Cliff rent and employ his son, Gary.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time, I had a registered company, Mickeycliff Pty Ltd, which made an offer to buy the restaurant. The offer was accepted, but then Cliff changed his mind about purchasing the freehold. This left me in a difficult position, with Mickeycliff Pty Ltd committed to the purchase. I felt I had no choice but to move forward with the deal&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t want a court case hanging over me.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caxton Street is a very busy area, situated near Suncorp Stadium. It&rsquo;s a vibrant nightlife hub, and at the top of the street, the old Victoria Barracks was slated to be transformed into a residential and shopping precinct.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the excitement of this business venture, things between Sheila and me were not going well&mdash;we seemed to be drifting apart. While Sheila supported me in her own way, she was never interested in mixing or socializing with others, nor did she enjoy taking holidays with me. As long as she could get to church or use public transport to travel in or out of the city, she was content.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sheila didn&rsquo;t drive and had no desire to learn.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we returned to Brisbane to take over the running of the restaurants, we bought a lovely three-bedroom apartment in Paddington. It was conveniently close to Caxton Street, making it easier for me to manage Caf&eacute; Mediterraneo, and close to the city for Sheila.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Caf&eacute; Mediterraneo was a disaster. The Brisbane Broncos moved from Suncorp Stadium to the ANZ Stadium in Mt Gravatt, leaving a significant gap in foot traffic on Caxton Street. Patrons no longer frequented the area for food and drinks. Additionally, the planned residential apartments and shopping precinct at the old barracks were shelved due to heritage restrictions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caxton Street was full of restaurants, including Gambaro&rsquo;s, The LA Pub, Caxton Street Hotel, Casablanca Restaurant, Gambero&rsquo;s Seafood and Takeaway, and several nightclubs. The competition was intense, and trade was almost non-existent in the early days of the week. While Saturdays brought large bookings for hens&rsquo; nights, birthdays, and other celebrations&mdash;thanks to our courtyard&mdash;it still needed major repairs. During storms, the courtyard leaked everywhere, creating a constant challenge.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around this time, Cliff and Zoe decided to move to Canada, though their departure didn&rsquo;t make much of a difference since they had been living in Noosa and weren&rsquo;t actively involved in the restaurant. However, early in my lease, Cliff decided he didn&rsquo;t like the color of the building&rsquo;s exterior. Without consulting me or the landlord, he had Gary repaint it. Unsurprisingly, the landlord was furious. I tried to explain that changes like this required the landlord&rsquo;s permission, but they wouldn&rsquo;t listen.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another incident occurred just before I decided to sell the restaurant. The flat above the caf&eacute; had a bedroom, living room, bathroom, and kitchen where Gary lived. After taking a few days off, I returned to find that Gary had completely ripped out the kitchen and was renovating it. When I asked if he had obtained the landlord&rsquo;s permission, he admitted he hadn&rsquo;t, insisting he was "making it better." While Gary was a skilled carpenter, he didn&rsquo;t understand that you can&rsquo;t make unauthorized changes to leased premises.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By this point, I had already decided to sell Caf&eacute; Mediterraneo and had placed it on the market. I didn&rsquo;t tell Gary about my plans at the time but urged him to finish the renovations quickly and hoped the landlord wouldn&rsquo;t show up for an inspection in the meantime.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">On top of business struggles, my personal life was deteriorating. Sheila and I grew increasingly distant. While she supported me in her own way, she avoided socializing or joining me on holidays, preferring her own routine centered around church and city visits. These issues compounded the stress of running the caf&eacute;, which was draining me financially.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, I decided to sell Caf&eacute; Mediterrano at a loss to cut my losses and move on.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The new owner converted it into an Irish pub, which turned out to be a better fit for the area, though it required significant investment to succeed.</p>
