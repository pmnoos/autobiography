            <h2><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Finding Contentment Reflections on Time, Happiness, and Life&rsquo;s Journey.</strong></p></h2>
        
 <hr>       
        <div class="content">
            <p>I never really thought about my age or how old I was&mdash;New Zealand had that kind of effect on you. Life here was so laid-back and easygoing that it almost felt timeless. Perhaps it was because we were truly happy, immersed in the simple joys of everyday life, that age never crossed our minds. We were too busy appreciating the beauty around us, the freedom to explore, and the sense of belonging we had created for ourselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Looking back now, I realize that this contentment came from more than just the lifestyle; it stemmed from the life we had built&mdash;a life where we could truly be happy. We had worked hard to create stability and found joy in the moments that mattered most. It was a time of fulfillment, where the weight of life&rsquo;s worries seemed lighter, and for that, I am deeply grateful.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I mention this reflection about age because of a particular experience I had at the gym. The gym was owned by Harry, a former naval instructor&mdash;a strict but kind man who was always great to talk to. On one visit, it was time for my three-month assessment, which Harry conducted with all his clients.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; During the assessment, Harry sat me down for a chat and, out of the blue, asked how old I was. To my surprise, I couldn&rsquo;t think of the answer right away. I hesitated and said, "38, maybe 39?" Harry quickly retorted, "You&rsquo;re nearly 41!" as he glanced at my profile card. Then, with a grin, he added, "Don&rsquo;t you know when you were born?" We had a good laugh about it, but the moment stuck with me.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It dawned on me how many years had gone by without me even noticing. Life had been so full and satisfying that I hadn&rsquo;t stopped to reflect on the passage of time. It was a humorous yet poignant reminder of how deeply immersed I had been in the happiness and rhythm of daily life.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Around this time, after selling the business, we were able to pay off the mortgage and settle other debts, leaving us debt-free. By then, I was in my early forties. Paul and Kathryn were considering university, Julia was exploring career options, Phillip had one year left at college, and Carolyn was enrolled at Carmel College.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sheila wasn&rsquo;t interested in traveling overseas, as we had already enjoyed numerous holidays across New Zealand during our time here. These trips were wonderful and created lasting memories for the whole family. By now, we had been in New Zealand for twelve years, and I had always told my family in the UK that I would return to visit them within ten years. It felt like the right time to make that trip.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thanks to my former employment with Air New Zealand, we were still eligible for reduced airline fares, so I went ahead and booked the journey. As Sheila preferred not to travel, Paul, who had recently obtained his driver&rsquo;s license, stepped up. He was more than capable of driving my car and taking Sheila and the family out whenever needed. He did an incredible job looking after everything in my absence, ensuring the family was well cared for.</p>
