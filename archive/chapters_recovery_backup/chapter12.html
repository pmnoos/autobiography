            <h2><h3 class="subtitle-section">Hospitality, I realized, could be an unsociable trade, with long hours spent working evenings, weekends, and public holidays. Seeking a more stable and fulfilling career path, I started exploring other options.</h3></h2>

            <p class="paragraph body-paragraph-tutorial">I eventually came upon an advertisement for a career opportunity at the Post Office, focusing on telecommunications. After attending several interviews, I was fortunate to secure a position as a trainee at the telephone service of the UK General Post Office. Leaving my job at the Grapes was bittersweet; while I had formed strong bonds with Mr. and Mrs. Boyes, they understood the transient nature of the hospitality industry, where gaining diverse experience often means moving on.<br><br>Upon starting my employment, I found myself part of a team of men, traveling in a well-equipped vehicle laden with various tools and equipment. Our primary responsibilities included installing telegraph poles and telephone kiosks, as well as repairing lines damaged by storms. Clad in excellent work attire, I relished the opportunity to work outdoors, despite the physical demands of our tasks. My colleagues, a group of down-to-earth individuals, differed greatly from those I had encountered on ships and in hotels. However, I quickly assimilated into their camaraderie and was eventually accepted as one of their own. My time with this team served as an observation period for my work ethic and demeanor. After six months, I was selected to attend a ten day course at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Bletchley-Park" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bletchley Park,</a>&nbsp;focusing on the fundamentals of telephony.<br>Although it was challenging for Sheila, my absence was punctuated by weekend visits home.<br>The photo at the top of the page, showing men strapped into the top of a telegraph pole, brings back memories of a rather amusing exercise. The aim was to simulate working on wires and insulators by strapping oneself in and leaning out. However, in reality, the process of climbing several meters and securing oneself was quite different. I vividly recall my own experiences, including one where I scaled heights of over 60m, such as those along the seafront in Herne Bay, Kent. Especially in the chilly winter weather, it was an adventure that left a lasting impression.<br>Upon completing the course, I was assigned to a smaller team, comprising four men and a foreman, tasked with installing wires between telegraph poles. Fresh from my training at Bletchley Park, I eagerly took on the responsibility of climbing poles to connect wires. I cherished our outings into the countryside, where we enjoyed makeshift picnics during breaks, brewing hot tea and sharing meals.<br>Subsequent to another six-month stint, I returned to Bletchley Park for further training, this time delving deeper into the workings of telephony and equipment installation. Following this, I joined yet another team, this time focusing on wiring from telegraph poles to buildings where telephones were to be installed. Within weeks, I found myself installing telephones in various locations, relishing the opportunity to interact with homeowners and business proprietors, and finding a sense of fulfillment in the creative process.<br>After several months of working with a gang on installations, I was offered a position as a solo fitter. In this role, I would be equipped with a bag of tools and apparatus and tasked with independently installing telephone extensions at various premises. Additionally, a vehicle was provided for me.<br>However, before I could take up this position, I needed to have a valid driving license. I otained the driving test just the previuos year year After completing a driving test, the instructor remarked on an amusing incident: I had mistakenly turned left when asked to turn right, and vice versa. Despite these nervous errors, the instructor commended my overall driving ability and passed me.So obtaining the license marked another milestone in my journey towards becoming a solo fitter with the GPO (General Post Office).<br>Life was going well; I was enjoying my new career, while Paul was growing up as a contented baby, looked after by Sheila, who also prepared delicious meals for us all.<br>Despite starting at the bottom of the pay scale at GPO and taking a significant pay cut, we managed decently without having to pay rent. However, we handled all the food shopping and utilities ourselves, managing to save a little along the way.<br>But then, something happened that disrupted our peaceful life. To this day, I'm unsure of the exact cause. Sheila and her father, Henry, had a falling out. Being caught in the middle of two stubborn Irish individuals who refused to give in was challenging. My loyalty naturally lay with Sheila, and after three to four weeks of tension, it became clear that staying at Red Lion Cottages was no longer feasible.</p>
