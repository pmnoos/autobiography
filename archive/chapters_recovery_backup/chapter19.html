        <div class="content">
            <p data-start="257" data-end="610">We arrived in Brisbane for the World Expo in the second week of April 1988. The Expo had just opened that month and was set to run until October. It was a great opportunity to find employment. With my roots in the UK, I applied to work at the English stand and was instantly hired as a Chef at the Britannia Inn&mdash;a replica of a traditional English pub.</p>
<p data-start="612" data-end="1010">The shifts were long and incredibly busy, but it was a lot of fun. The atmosphere was completely different from anything I had experienced before. The Expo provided a <strong data-start="779" data-end="799">captive audience</strong>, and the crowds were there purely for enjoyment. Those of us working in the various country stands were there not just to serve but to <strong data-start="935" data-end="946">enhance</strong> visitors&rsquo; experiences by representing our respective nations.</p>
<p data-start="1012" data-end="1379">I worked at the Britannia Inn until the end of the Expo. The restaurant was operated by <strong data-start="1100" data-end="1128">David Peters Restaurants</strong>, which had won the contract to run it. It was so successful that they purchased the replica pub, obtained the necessary permissions, and reopened it in Brisbane&rsquo;s Hyatt Arcade in November. They offered me a chef&rsquo;s position, which I gladly accepted.</p>
<p data-start="1381" data-end="1898">At the Expo, the Britannia Pub had both an <strong data-start="1424" data-end="1442">Executive Chef</strong> and a <strong data-start="1449" data-end="1462">Head Chef</strong>. Each week, they would arrive dressed immaculately in freshly laundered uniforms, with their chef hats getting progressively taller. This went on for several months, each trying to <strong data-start="1644" data-end="1653">outdo</strong> the other. Word spread across the Expo site, and it became a source of amusement for other restaurant teams, with their own chefs joining in the hat competition. It was hilarious to watch these self-important chefs parade around, showing off.</p>
<p data-start="1900" data-end="2266">Ironically, neither the Executive Chef nor the Head Chef actually worked in the kitchen with me and the rest of the team. By the end of the first week at the newly opened <strong data-start="2071" data-end="2096">Britannia in Brisbane</strong>, both were gone&mdash;the Executive Chef was <strong data-start="2136" data-end="2146">sacked</strong>, and the Head Chef managed to <strong data-start="2177" data-end="2199">chop off his thumb</strong> while demonstrating to apprentice chefs how to cut up a chicken!</p>
<p data-start="2268" data-end="2554">Shortly after, I was offered the <strong data-start="2301" data-end="2314">Head Chef</strong> position, which I accepted. The owners brought in a new <strong data-start="2371" data-end="2389">Executive Chef</strong>, a Spanish gentleman. It was a strange setup&mdash;despite being Head Chef, I was never consulted on how the restaurant should operate or what direction it should take.</p>
<p data-start="2556" data-end="2929">At one point, the restaurant introduced a <strong data-start="2598" data-end="2613">new kitchen</strong> at the back, facing <strong data-start="2634" data-end="2659">Elizabeth Street Mall</strong>. It had an <strong data-start="2671" data-end="2690">Oriental design</strong> and served cuisine to match. They hired a <strong data-start="2733" data-end="2746">Thai chef</strong> to run that section, meaning I had no involvement in it. My expertise at the time was in <strong data-start="2836" data-end="2868">Italian, French, and English</strong> cuisine, so I didn&rsquo;t know much about <strong data-start="2906" data-end="2926">Oriental cooking</strong>.</p>
<p data-start="2931" data-end="3284">Months passed, and the Britannia was doing <strong data-start="2974" data-end="2989">big numbers</strong>. Everything seemed to be going well, but the Executive Chef became increasingly agitated. Eventually, he pulled me aside and asked me to <strong data-start="3127" data-end="3155">defend him to the owners</strong>. I had no idea what was going on. I&rsquo;ve never liked getting involved in <strong data-start="3227" data-end="3258">workplace politics or drama</strong>, so I stayed out of it.</p>
<p data-start="3286" data-end="3415">Just before I was offered the Head Chef position, I had been looking into a <strong data-start="3362" data-end="3387">franchise opportunity</strong> with <strong data-start="3393" data-end="3412">Silvio&rsquo;s Pizzas</strong>&hellip;</p>
<h3 data-start="313" data-end="361"><strong data-start="317" data-end="359">Silvio&rsquo;s Pizza: A Franchise Experience</strong></h3>
<p data-start="363" data-end="601">Just before I was offered the Head Chef&rsquo;s position, I had been exploring a business opportunity with <strong data-start="464" data-end="482">Silvio&rsquo;s Pizza</strong>, a franchise run by an Italian family. The company operated <strong data-start="543" data-end="568">pizza delivery stores</strong> throughout Brisbane&rsquo;s suburbs.</p>
<p data-start="603" data-end="844">Like any business, I knew it was important to <strong data-start="649" data-end="672">do my due diligence</strong>, so I took the franchise's financial records to an accountant. He was supposed to <strong data-start="755" data-end="794">investigate the business thoroughly</strong>, and his conclusion? <em data-start="816" data-end="842">"Everything seems fine."</em></p>
<p data-start="846" data-end="980">With that assurance, I <strong data-start="869" data-end="886">struck a deal</strong> with the main figure running the business&mdash;one of the family members, whose name was Silvio.</p>
<h3 data-start="982" data-end="1023"><strong data-start="986" data-end="1021">Running the Stones Corner Store</strong></h3>
<p data-start="1025" data-end="1413">The store I acquired was located in <strong data-start="1061" data-end="1078">Stones Corner</strong>, a <strong data-start="1082" data-end="1129">busy suburb close to Brisbane&rsquo;s city center</strong>. It had been managed by one of Silvio&rsquo;s appointed managers before I took over. To maintain consistency, I <strong data-start="1236" data-end="1257">kept him on staff</strong>, along with several young men&mdash;mostly students&mdash;who worked as delivery drivers. We didn&rsquo;t want to interfere with the <strong data-start="1373" data-end="1395">flow of production</strong> and operations.</p>
<p data-start="1415" data-end="1648">At first, the store seemed like a <strong data-start="1449" data-end="1469">great investment</strong>. It was <strong data-start="1478" data-end="1510">busy every night of the week</strong>, especially during the dinner period. But after <strong data-start="1559" data-end="1581">five or six months</strong>, I began to notice that <strong data-start="1606" data-end="1645">things weren&rsquo;t quite as they seemed</strong>.</p>
<p data-start="1650" data-end="1882">At the same time, another <strong data-start="1676" data-end="1707">franchise store in Capalaba</strong> had been sold to another franchisee. Every <strong data-start="1751" data-end="1764">two weeks</strong>, we attended <strong data-start="1778" data-end="1800">franchise meetings</strong> at Silvio&rsquo;s head office to discuss marketing strategies and promotional offers.</p>
<p data-start="1884" data-end="1931">And that&rsquo;s when we made a shocking discovery.</p>
<h3 data-start="1933" data-end="1983"><strong data-start="1937" data-end="1981">The Truth About Silvio&rsquo;s Franchise Model</strong></h3>
<p data-start="1985" data-end="2071">It turned out that <strong data-start="2004" data-end="2068">me and the Capalaba owner were the only two real franchisees</strong>.</p>
<p data-start="2073" data-end="2296">Every other Silvio&rsquo;s store was being managed by <strong data-start="2121" data-end="2140">young employees</strong> who had no experience running a business. They were only trained to do one thing:<br data-start="2222" data-end="2225">👉 <strong data-start="2228" data-end="2294">Make pizzas as fast as possible and get them out for delivery.</strong></p>
<p data-start="2298" data-end="2428">But there were <strong data-start="2313" data-end="2328">major flaws</strong> in the business model that neither my accountant nor I had picked up on. The biggest issues were:</p>
<p data-start="2430" data-end="2464">1️⃣ <strong data-start="2434" data-end="2462">The "Two-for-One" Offer:</strong></p>
<ul data-start="2468" data-end="2730">
<li data-start="2468" data-end="2570">This deal was run <strong data-start="2488" data-end="2502">frequently</strong>, yet franchisees still had to pay <strong data-start="2537" data-end="2567">full price for ingredients</strong>.</li>
<li data-start="2574" data-end="2730">When we asked how we were supposed to make a profit while giving away half our pizzas, their answer was: <em data-start="2681" data-end="2728">"You&rsquo;ll sell more pizzas and make more cash."</em></li>
</ul>
<p data-start="2732" data-end="2777">2️⃣ <strong data-start="2736" data-end="2775">The "Free Pizza if Late" Guarantee:</strong></p>
<ul data-start="2781" data-end="3168">
<li data-start="2781" data-end="2851">If deliveries were <strong data-start="2802" data-end="2813">delayed</strong>, the customer got a <strong data-start="2834" data-end="2848">free pizza</strong>.</li>
<li data-start="2855" data-end="3049">This happened <strong data-start="2871" data-end="2887">all the time</strong> during Queensland&rsquo;s <strong data-start="2908" data-end="2924">storm season</strong> (from late October to late February), when heavy rain would hit Brisbane <strong data-start="2998" data-end="3022">almost every evening</strong> between <strong data-start="3031" data-end="3046">4 PM &ndash; 8 PM</strong>.</li>
<li data-start="3053" data-end="3168">Our delivery drivers struggled in these conditions, meaning <strong data-start="3115" data-end="3165">we were constantly giving away pizzas for free</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p data-start="3170" data-end="3385">We fought back, demanding <strong data-start="3196" data-end="3207">changes</strong> to these policies. We suggested:<br data-start="3240" data-end="3243">✔️ Either <strong data-start="3253" data-end="3268">discounting</strong> the cost of ingredients for two-for-one nights.<br data-start="3316" data-end="3319">✔️ Suspending the <strong data-start="3337" data-end="3358">free pizza policy</strong> during the storm season.</p>
<p data-start="3387" data-end="3410"><strong data-start="3387" data-end="3408">Silvio&rsquo;s refused.</strong></p>
<h3 data-start="3412" data-end="3448"><strong data-start="3416" data-end="3446">Locked Out of My Own Store</strong></h3>
<p data-start="3450" data-end="3563">Every franchise meeting turned into a battle between us and Silvio&rsquo;s management. Eventually, they&rsquo;d had enough.</p>
<p data-start="3565" data-end="3645">One day, <strong data-start="3574" data-end="3642">both I and the Capalaba franchisee were locked out of our stores</strong>.</p>
<p data-start="3647" data-end="3714">I didn&rsquo;t fight it. To be honest, I was <strong data-start="3686" data-end="3711">relieved to walk away</strong>.</p>
<p data-start="3716" data-end="3994">My original deal had been that I&rsquo;d place a <strong data-start="3759" data-end="3776">small deposit</strong> and pay the rest after selling my business in New Zealand. Since I had kept postponing the payment, I hadn&rsquo;t lost too much money in the process. But I can&rsquo;t say what happened to the <strong data-start="3959" data-end="3979">other franchisee</strong> in Capalaba.</p>
<p data-start="3996" data-end="4132">As for Silvio&rsquo;s? Their model was <strong data-start="4029" data-end="4046">unsustainable</strong>, and they soon realized they couldn&rsquo;t expand interstate under their own brand name.</p>
<p data-start="4134" data-end="4204">That&rsquo;s when an opportunity arose&mdash;<strong data-start="4167" data-end="4201">Domino&rsquo;s Pizza was up for sale</strong>.</p>
<p data-start="4206" data-end="4314">Silvio&rsquo;s acquired <strong data-start="4224" data-end="4236">Domino&rsquo;s</strong>, rebranded their stores, and began growing the business under the new name.</p>
<p data-start="4316" data-end="4487">And here&rsquo;s the twist&mdash;one of those young <strong data-start="4356" data-end="4374">store managers</strong> from the Silvio&rsquo;s days eventually <strong data-start="4409" data-end="4435">bought out the company</strong>. Today, he is the <strong data-start="4454" data-end="4484">CEO of Domino&rsquo;s Queensland</strong>.</p>
