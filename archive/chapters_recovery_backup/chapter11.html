            <h2><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; Herne Bay is a seaside town on the north coast of Kent in South East England. It is 6 miles (10 km) north of Canterbury.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&nbsp;The town rose to prominence as a seaside resort during the early 19th century after a group of London investors built a pleasure pier and promenade, and it reached its heyday in the late Victorian era.</strong><br><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p></h2>
        
 <hr>       
        <div class="content">
            <p>The situation had become too volatile. Regrettably, our little bubble burst, and we had to find a new place to live. This left me in an awkward position as I needed to appease Sheila while also finding suitable accommodation. Unfortunately, the rents where we were located were exorbitantly high, making it impractical to stay. With that, we expanded our search and found a location within our budget in Herne Bay on the Kent coast.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I then needed to arrange an interview with my superiors at the post office to explain my situation and request a transfer to the nearest GPO depot to Herne Bay. Their initial reaction was less than enthusiastic. They expressed discontent, citing the time and money they had invested in training me for their area, which they feared would not yield a return.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After about 10 days, I was called into the GPO offices, where they reluctantly agreed to let me go and transfer me to the Canterbury depot. However, this meant starting over with a gang again. I expressed my reluctance but explained that I felt I had no choice as our living arrangements were becoming untenable for my wife and son. As winter approached, we decided to move out. With the help of a mover, we transported our few possessions from the cottages to our new rental, an apartment situated right on the seafront. It was on the second floor, and it boasted splendid views of the sea, albeit accompanied by gusty winds and chilly temperatures.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; During our time there, we primarily inhabited the kitchen and bedroom, reserving the lounge area for storing our food since we didn't own a refrigerator, making the space too cold for extended stays.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Commute to the Canterbury depot from Herne Bay involved catching a bus departing at 5:45 in the morning, ensuring my punctuality for the 7:30 start. Following the instructions from my superiors in Slough, I integrated into a group of men, starting afresh to demonstrate my capabilities and dedication to the work. Eventually, I earned their acceptance, although it came with disappointment as my pay rate decreased.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Despite the chilly climate, there were positives to our new location. We found solace in the nearby Catholic church, where we often attended mass, pushing Paul in his pram along the promenade on sunny days. Additionally, having Brother Lionel reside in Canterbury brought us joy through his frequent visits. These occasions provided opportunities to reconnect and even introduced us to June, his wife, who was a school teacher. Sheila shared the exciting news with me that she was pregnant, and we were expecting an addition to the family around May.</p>
<p>Knowing this and realising that our lease on the apartment would soon expire, and with the prospect of a rent increase for the summer season looming, we felt compelled to explore other housing options. Determined to find a more permanent solution, I began familiarizing myself with the area and neighboring towns, actively searching for alternatives that would better suit our needs.&lt;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; While scanning rental advertisements, I stumbled upon an intriguing offer aimed at assisting individuals in purchasing their own homes. Intrigued, I contacted the advertiser and discovered that the Canterbury City Council was approving home loans for eligible applicants. This revelation prompted a shift in my mindset from longing for a rental to considering the possibility of homeownership.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After discussing the offer with the representative, we established a budget within which we could comfortably purchase a house. To my delight, I found a terraced home located at 2 Albion Place, just two streets away from Canterbury Cathedral, listed at &pound;19,000. Following the representative's suggestion, I made an offer of &pound;18,000, which was accepted quite a pleasant surprise!<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With the assistance of our modest savings and a mortgage at a low interest rate, we were able to enter the property market and secure our own home. After completing all the necessary legal procedures and signing away what felt like my life, I officially became a homeowner. Our new residence was 2 Albion Place, nestled in a quiet cul-de-sac just a stone's throw away from the bustling city of Canterbury. This terraced house, dating back to the 1890s, boasted three bedrooms and a recently constructed bathroom with a toilet and an extension that modernized the home.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On the ground floor, we found a spacious front room, a large kitchen with a scullery adjacent to it, and a small back garden featuring the customary outdoor WC typical of homes from that era. While the condition of the house wasn't flawless, the front bedroom upstairs required some attention. we could overlook this for the time being, as it wasn't immediately necessary for our use. The layout posed a slight inconvenience, as accessing the bathroom required passing through the third bedroom, but it was a minor inconvenience in the grand scheme of owning our piece of property, assuming we could keep up with the mortgage payments, of course. <a title="Canterbury" href="core\media\images\canterbury.jpg">&lt;h2&gt;Canterbury&lt;/h2&gt;</a><br><a title="Canterbury" href="core\media\images\canterbury.jpg">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;div class="responsive-picture picture"&gt;</a><br><a title="Canterbury" href="core\media\images\canterbury.jpg">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;picture&gt;</a><br><a title="Canterbury" href="core\media\images\canterbury.jpg">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;img alt="Placeholder Picture" width="1920" height="1199" src="./images/canterbury.jpg" loading="lazy"&gt;</a><br><a title="Canterbury" href="core\media\images\canterbury.jpg">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/picture&gt;</a><br><a title="Canterbury" href="core\media\images\canterbury.jpg">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/div&gt;</a><br><a title="Canterbury" href="core\media\images\canterbury.jpg">&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;h3 class="subtitle-section"&gt;</a>Canterbury, a cathedral city in southeast England, was a pilgrimage site in the Middle Ages. Ancient walls, originally built by the Romans, encircle its medieval centre with cobbled streets and timber-framed houses. Canterbury Cathedral, founded 597 A.D., is the headquarters of the Church of England and Anglican Communion, incorporating Gothic and Romanesque elements in its stone carvings and stained-glass windows. &lt;/h3&gt;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;p class="paragraph body-paragraph-tutorial"&gt;After settling into our new home over the course of several months, and with a reduction in my wages at the post office, it became apparent that to meet our financial needs and obligations, I would need to supplement our income. Drawing on my catering experience, I embarked on a mission to secure part-time work at the various hotels in Canterbury, specifically aiming for positions in their restaurants that offered evening, weekend, and public holiday shifts.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Despite facing several rejections, I eventually secured a part-time waiter position at the Slatters Hotel, which provided the additional income we required. &lt;a href="images/Slatters-Hotel-postcard-Canterbury.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;The Slatters Hotel&lt;/a&gt; was particularly busy, especially during the summer months, resulting in my part-time hours extending to nearly every night, weekend, and public holiday. Understandably, this schedule became overwhelming for Sheila to manage on her own.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; As the time for our baby's arrival drew nearer, Sheila received the news that the baby was due in just a few weeks. Given our decision for a home birth, we were visited by the local midwife, whose arrival coincided with one of her scheduled visits. It was during this visit that Sheila's water broke unexpectedly right at the front door, marking the beginning of our daughter's journey into the world.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Julia was born on the 12th of May, 1962, right in our home at 2 Albion Place. I returned from work to the joyous news of becoming a father to a beautiful daughter.&lt;br&gt;Our household possessions were very sparse, and we were in need of several appliances: a fridge, washing machine, and dryer. In fact, we lacked many things that would make a comfortable home. Now, we have two lovely children, gifted to me and Sheila. It became my responsibility to care for them. Even with my part-time work, acquiring the funds we needed was a slow process.&lt;br/&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Lionel visited us regularly. He had a job with the West Piling construction firm. How he obtained such a position is beyond me; as far as I know, he was a petty officer in the catering department of the Royal Navy. Nonetheless, he repeatedly urged me to join him, promising considerable pay increases compared to my current income. When I inquired about the amount, he mentioned it would likely be double what I was earning at the time. Naturally, I asked what the catch was. His response was that we would have to travel to different sites daily until our assigned tasks were completed. Currently, the job was at the &lt;a href="../MyStory/images/dungenesspower.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;Dungeness Power Station&lt;/a&gt;. Lionel assured me he would provide transportation and cover the cost of travel.&lt;br/&gt;Knowing nothing about construction, I understood that we would be working as laborers for a flat rate of &Acirc;&pound;20, with additional compensation for travel time and overtime. This seemed like significant money, especially considering that my current income at the GPO was &pound;12 per week, and I earned &pound;1.50 per hour at my part-time job. However, accepting Lionel's offer would mean giving up my career at the GPO in telecommunications.&lt;br/&gt;What do you do when your family needs the comfort and security of a home with the amenities they deserve? I found myself grappling with this question. I approached my superiors at the GPO and requested a pay raise, hoping to better provide for my family. However, my request was swiftly denied without consideration.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In their stead, they suggested I enroll in night school and study for the Elementary Telecommunications Practice exam. Passing this exam would elevate me to a higher pay rate, but the course would take 12 to 18 months, with no guarantee of success.&lt;br/&gt;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Over the next few days, Sheila and I deliberated Lionel's offer. Sheila astutely reminded me that I had left the hospitality industry to be present at home during evenings, weekends, and public holidays. Her point resonated deeply with me. Thus, with a heavy heart, I made the difficult decision to tender my resignation to the GPO and join Lionel's team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As Lionel had informed me, we were assigned to work at the Dungeness Power Station, a duty that lasted for many weeks. Our mornings began early, with a one-hour drive to reach the station. Despite the long hours, I was grateful to be back home in the evenings. Some Saturdays offered overtime opportunities, which we eagerly seized, but we always cherished Sundays and public holidays spent with our family.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Our task at the station involved arranging templates for the bases of the large pylons that would eventually carry power to the national grid.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; During the Easter holidays, we organized Julias baptism, anticipating the arrival of visitors from Sheila's hometown of Blackburn Auntie Kitty and Uncle Bill, who graciously agreed to be Julias godparents. Recognizing our limited space, they stayed at Slatters Hotel instead of with us at 2 Albion Place. Despite our humble accommodations, we did our best to extend hospitality with whatever resources we had at the time, even though I had only recently started working at the power station.&lt;br/&gt;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Having family around us was a joy, and Kitty and Bill were delightful guests. However, Sheila later mentioned that Kitty had not been impressed with 2 Albion Place, which left a lasting impression on me.&lt;br/&gt;We continued to work at the power station for several months. It was certainly an eye opener to be working on such a large project. With working at the power station it really helped with my cash flow and we were able add to our comfort in the home. &lt;br/&gt;After the working at the power station we had a new assignment which took us to the outer suburb of London which was about another 30 mins to our travelling time. Lionel was still our transport, but things were getting a little disjointed&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; As Lionel was become unreliable by picking the team up late which made us late for signing on in the mornings and one day running out of petrol on the motorway. With each one of us showed our disappointment with him he told us that he has had enough of this job and is going leave.&lt;br/&gt;Of course, this situation left me very upset and unsure of what to do next. In hindsight, I should have seen it coming, but at the time, I felt I had burned my bridges with the Post Office. Returning to Slatters Hotel was not an ideal solution for me, as I was unhappy about giving up my position at the Post Office, despite the financial benefits. Ultimately, I made that choice for the money and for the well-being of my family.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In search of some clarity, we decided to visit Mum at clare House in Dover. During our conversation, she mentioned that the cross-channel ferry company I previously worked for had a new ship launching this summer and was looking for crew. I made a few inquiries with the company, and they were open to me applying for a position on the new ship.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Now, the challenge was that we were living in Canterbury. Mum and I also discussed a new housing development in Whitfield, just a couple of miles away from her place. We decided to check it out and found semi-detached, low-set houses for sale. If we could sell our home in Albion Place, there was a possibility we could afford one of these new houses, as the prices were manageable.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
