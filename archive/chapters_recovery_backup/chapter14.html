            <p>After settling into our New Zealand home, we explored the local area and discovered some lovely places with charming names: Takapuna, Mairangi Bay, Milford, Glenfield, Northcote, Birkenhead, Beach Haven, and Devonport, and great beaches all located on the North Shore.<br>What really stood out to us was the age of the cars. We hardly ever saw any latest models; most of them were at least 20-30 years old. The one I drove on the day of our arrival was an old Ford, but I wasn't complaining as it was great to have such transport provided for us.<br>One of my first tasks was to secure employment. While working on the ferries, I had met a family on holiday from New Zealand who managed a hotel and restaurant in Takapuna. I mentioned to them that I was planning to move to New Zealand with my family, and they kindly gave me their contact details, encouraging me to get in touch when I arrived. Additionally, I had written to Air New Zealand about my intended arrival and received a reply asking me to contact them upon my arrival.<br>I followed up on these employment contacts and started working a week after our arrival in the cocktail bar and restaurant at The Mon Desir Hotel, situated adjacent to Takapuna Beach. I also went for an interview with Air New Zealand personnel and was informed that I would be notified of the date for the next intake of cabin crew.<br><br>Paul, Julia &amp; Kathryn were enrolled in the local primary school, as Phillip was to young he stayed at home, good company for Sheila in those early days. We settled into a routine that included work, school, and exploring our new surroundings. We enjoyed the beautiful beaches and parks, taking the children out for picnics and walks along the coast. The weather was pleasant, and the scenery was breathtaking, making our transition to New Zealand feel like a dream come true.<br>I have to mention this unexpected event that happened a few days after our arrival in New Zealand. My family and I were walking along Takapuna High Street when a couple approached us. As they got closer, I turned to Sheila and remarked that they looked very familiar. Sheila let out a surprising gasp and said they were the postmaster and his wife from the Whitfield post office, where we had drawn the children&rsquo;s welfare benefits from the UK government. I had been at their post office just weeks before we left.<br>We stopped and talked about our voyage to New Zealand, and they told us they were on vacation visiting family. It was quite an event to meet people who lived so close to us back in the UK, and now we meet on the other side of the world.<br>We received some good news via a letter from our solicitor in Dover: the sale of our house was completed, and the remaining funds were deposited into our New Zealand bank account, which I had opened before leaving the UK. With this financial assurance, we decided to import a new vehicle into New Zealand. In those days, you had to apply for an import license and demonstrate that you had overseas funds to purchase a new vehicle. I was hoping to create a small profit from the import, which would go towards buying a new home.<br>In late July, I received notification from Air NZ that the new intake for the training school would begin in August 1967. I was scheduled to attend a preliminary induction day, and if that went well, I was to be prepared to start the training school on August 14th.<br>I completed the six-week training school and passed, marking the beginning of my flying career as flight crew. At that time, Air NZ, often referred to as "Air England" due to the majority of the cabin crew coming from the British Merchant Navy, was based in Auckland. We flew all around the South Pacific, including Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong, and the USA. Air NZ had personnel based in LA who handled the Honolulu to LA leg, with passengers going on to London typically flying with BA.<br>Our time away from home was relatively short, with the longest trips being a week away. Most of our flights were twice a week, allowing for three or four-day stopovers in most destinations. However, our weekly flights to Tahiti included a week-long stay in a tropical paradise&mdash;truly an unbeatable experience, especially while being paid to do it!During my first year with Air NZ, we imported a new car and managed to sell it, which allowed us to purchase a block of land, known as a section in New Zealand. With the help of the NZ government, we were able to obtain a low-interest loan to build a house on the section. When we constructed our house, we intentionally included a bedroom and bathroom for Henry to reside with us. Given my employment with an airline, my family and I had access to discounted fares, which allowed us to extend the opportunity to Henry to come and live with us in New Zealand.<br>Although he initially arrived with a sense of discontent, having experienced something troubling in the UK, we respected his privacy and never pressed him to discuss it. After 6-8 weeks, Henry started to go out on his own and visit Takapuna. Gradually, he began to get back to his old self, which was great for all of us. Though he was never ungrateful, he still had a lot of time for the children. One day, he came back and told us he had managed to get a job and had met a lady he was going on a date with. We were so excited for him; he really deserved some positivity in his life. Sheila&rsquo;s mother had passed away suddenly from cancer in 1954, so Henry had been on his own for all this time.<br>Thanks to the affordable fares provided for the families of airline employees, we were able to invite my mother to stay with us at our first home on Gordon Avenue, and later at Becroft Drive, which I will discuss further in this saga. The first visit was particularly special as Sheila was pregnant with our child, Carolyn, who was born on November 26, 1970. My mother was a tremendous help during this time. With my unpredictable flying schedule, it was challenging to take time off, especially since I never knew when the big moment would arrive. Fortunately, I was home that day, and I remember it vividly. It was a Thursday. I had just returned from a day trip to Fiji that morning. Sheila went into labor later that evening, and thankfully, my mother was there to support her along with the other children. The weather was dreadful; it had been pouring rain all day. At that time, I was driving a 1949/50 Ford Prefect, and since the driveway of our new home wasn&rsquo;t fully completed, I couldn&rsquo;t get the car onto solid concrete. We tried several times to drive up, but the car kept slipping in the mud as Sheila's labor pains intensified. In a moment of urgency, I dashed to the top of the driveway and noticed a vehicle parked nearby on Gordon Avenue. I knocked on the door relentlessly until someone answered. I explained the situation, and we quickly got into their vehicle, which we used to reverse down to our concrete drive. Once we got Sheila into the car, I called the hospital to inform them we were on our way. Remarkably, Carolyn was born within an hour of our arrival, and she was warmly welcomed by all of us. This was one of the happiest times in my life,<a href="http://127.0.0.1:5500/images/family.jpg">My family 1970</a>-surrounded by my family in our first NZ home:Sheila, my mother, Paul, Julia, Kathryn, Phillip, and our (KIWI) newborn, Carolyn.<br>There was an incident I need to discuss that occurred about ten days before Carolyn's birth. It was a lovely sunny day, and I was off work for a couple of days while Henry had gone to his job. We decided to pack a picnic and head to the beach. Upon arrival, we found a beautiful sheltered spot, and the children ran straight into the sea. A gentle breeze was blowing in from the ocean, making it a delightful day to enjoy the sunshine together. However, about thirty minutes later, I noticed a crowd gathering as the waves began to wash in more forcefully. Suddenly, I spotted a body lying in the sand and quickly jumped up to investigate. It was Phillip; he had been caught by the heavy waves and had stopped breathing. Thankfully, due to my training with Air New Zealand, I knew how to perform mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. As I worked to revive him, I noticed that everyone around was just standing and watching. I shouted for someone to call an ambulance. After several attempts, Phillip finally came around, and shortly after, an ambulance arrived to take him to the hospital. He was kept there for five days and underwent several chest X-rays before being discharged when everything was clear. I vividly remember visiting him in the hospital, where the nurse in charge of the ward gave me a stern talking-to. She criticized me for not being more responsible in watching my children, especially near the water. Even now, I still have nightmares about that day, and I recognize that the nurse had every right to address my negligence. I would never allow anything like that to happen again.<br>After that, everything settled down. Mum returned to the UK after being with us for several weeks, and her absence was deeply felt. The children started school: Paul attended Rossmini College, Julia went to Carmel College, and Kathryn joined Julia later after finishing primary school. A few years later, Phillip also joined Paul at his college. My career with Air New Zealand was progressing well, and I was promoted to Senior Steward. In this role, I was responsible for looking after all the passengers and flight crew in the economy section of the plane. Sheila kept busy with the children, of course, and whenever she could, she brought out her knitting machine. This hobby eventually blossomed into the business known as Magner Knitwear. This development leads me into the next chapter of our lives: the creation of Magner Knitwear</p>
