            <h2><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>We faced yet another life-changing decision: we could either remain a small cottage industry or take the leap to expand into a larger manufacturing operation. We went from working out of our home base to relocating and getting the machinery and stock out of the home</strong></p></h2>
        
 <hr>       
        <div class="content">
            <p>We moved the business out of our home as we learned to operate the commercial knitting machines. Along the way, we purchased two more machines. This led to three relocations, with the final one being a fully equipped factory featuring a mezzanine floor and ample space for additional production equipment. The last move was particularly beneficial&mdash;we ended up next to a bicycle shop that wanted to expand. They offered to find us a replacement location and cover the costs of setting up and moving all our machines. It was an offer we couldn&rsquo;t refuse. We settled well into our new premises and employed a small team of talented individuals, each with their area of expertise. We worked together until the early 1980s, and during that time, they all became close friends. Sheila returned to managing the home and caring for the children but continued to contribute to the business in her way.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; During this period, we upgraded our caravan to a six-berth Crusader. We purchased a &nbsp;<a href="../../../static/images/Caravan 1977 Edited.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chrysler Valiant</a> as a towing vehicle&mdash;a car I absolutely loved and still consider the best I&rsquo;ve ever owned. With this setup, we embarked on some amazing trips, including a memorable journey to South Island, traveling all the way down to Christchurch.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We also moved into a bigger home, a newly built six-bedroom house with a rumpus room and all the modern amenities. After some time, we installed a swimming pool, which added so much enjoyment to our lives. I even had the chance to bring my mother out for another visit, which was truly special.&lt;br/&gt;Life was good, though a little hectic at times with Magner Knitwear, while I continued flying with Air New Zealand. The airline was also expanding, with more aircraft allowing for increased frequencies and new destinations. This meant my downtime between flights was kept to a bare minimum.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Eventually, Jumbo jets arrived, and our trips away grew longer, sometimes lasting up to 19 days. Upon returning from a trip, we would typically receive a new roster. Most of the time, we were given the standard three days off, only to be back on standby on the fourth day, ready for several possible flights or assigned to a specific one. After completing my training for the Jumbos, I was added to their flight roster. In time, I found myself assigned to the extensive 19-day trips with the following route: Auckland &ndash; Honolulu &ndash; Los Angeles &ndash; Tahiti &ndash; Los Angeles &ndash; Honolulu &ndash; Auckland. While it might sound exotic, the reality was far less glamorous. We had only the bare minimum time off between flights, and crossing six different time zones on the return trip made maintaining a proper sleep pattern nearly impossible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The flights were usually full and incredibly busy, with the economy section alone accommodating 380&ndash;400 passengers. On one particular trip, I returned home utterly exhausted. To my surprise, when I checked my next roster, I saw that I was on standby for the same 19-day flight just three days later.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Normally, being called out on standby was infrequent, as crew members understood how such assignments could impact one another. But this time, I was called back for the same demanding itinerary. The strain was immense&mdash;not just for me but also for Sheila and the family. By the time I returned home from the second trip, I was knackered.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the end, I had to see the company doctor, who agreed that the schedule had been far too taxing for my body. As a result, I was granted three weeks of leave to recover.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sharing this because it led to my decision to resign from Air New Zealand. After taking another three weeks off, I still didn&rsquo;t feel quite right. I was offered additional time off, but I felt it was the right moment to step away&mdash;for my family&rsquo;s sake. The children were growing older, and I wanted to spend more time with them before they became too independent. I also wanted to give Sheila more support and dedicate myself more fully to Magner Knitwear.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With a heavy heart, I wrote my resignation letter. I had spent nearly eight years with Air New Zealand, and while it was difficult to leave, I knew it was the right decision. Shortly after, I received a thoughtful letter from the company expressing regret at my departure and thanking me for my service. It was a kind and personal gesture, and I truly appreciated it.&lt;br/&gt;Just after I resigned from Air New Zealand, we received the terrible news of an aircraft crash in Antarctica. After the delivery of the DC10 jumbo jet, Air New Zealand started sightseeing flights over the Antarctic. The Mount Erebus disaster occurred on 28 November 1979, when Air New Zealand Flight 901 flew into Mount Erebus on Ross Island, Antarctica, killing all 237 passengers and 20 crew members on board. Air New Zealand has been operating scheduled Antarctic sightseeing flights since 1977.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I was devastated by the news. I knew all the crew and had flown with them, especially the cabin crew. While I was never rostered for these flights, it could very well have been my turn. It took a long time to get over this tragedy.&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Erebus_disaster"&gt;If you would like to read more about the disaster&lt;/a&gt;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;br&gt;Around that time, New Zealand underwent a significant shift by removing most import licensing and opening the country to products from around the world. This change flooded the market with cheap imports, which posed challenges for local businesses like ours.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unfortunately, the removal of import licensing didn&rsquo;t benefit us much. While we could now import as much knitting yarn as needed, the prices remained unchanged. Within a month of this policy change, our wholesaler showed us samples of imported babywear he could source, along with the prices he&rsquo;d pay for them.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Having just left Air New Zealand, this wasn&rsquo;t the future we had envisioned. The imported products were incredibly cheap, and competing with those prices seemed almost impossible. We quickly realized we needed to rethink our approach if we wanted to continue operating. The move into the bigger home was great for the children, as each got their bedroom, and we had a rumpus room. We also installed a swimming pool, and we had great times all around.</p>
<p>However, having left Air New Zealand and with Magner Knitwear undergoing significant changes to remain competitive, I was unknowingly affected. I began to stress out and experienced periods of depression and anxiety, which I referred to as the "black dog." I tried to keep it to myself, but it probably showed when my alcohol intake increased. Unfortunately, Sheila bore the brunt of it all.&lt;br/&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This difficult period lasted for about 12 to 18 months. Eventually, the business stabilized, and we were making a living from it, but the enjoyment and creativity were gone. I decided it was time to change my lifestyle. I started jogging, joined a gym, and attended philosophy lessons twice a week for four years. I learned a lot from these lessons and have continued going to the gym for over 40 years.&lt;br/&gt;I also started to look for a new business opportunity. I had always been interested in real estate, so I decided to get my real estate license. I worked for a company called Barfoot &amp; Thompson, which was a great experience. I enjoyed the work and the people I met, but I found it challenging to make a living from it. I was used to a regular income, and real estate was very unpredictable. I decided to leave the industry and look for something else.</p>
<p>Around this time, we were approached by a company that wanted to buy Magner Knitwear. They offered us a good price, and we accepted. We sold the business and moved on to new ventures. It was a bittersweet moment, as we had put so much time and effort into building Magner Knitwear. However, it was time to let Magner Knitwear go. We had taken it as far as we could, so we placed it on the market, and it sold after about a year.</p>

I was offered additional time off, but I felt it was the right moment to step away&mdash;for my family&rsquo;s sake. The children were growing older, and I wanted to spend more time with them before they became too independent. I also wanted to give Sheila more support and dedicate myself more fully to Magner Knitwear.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With a heavy heart, I wrote my resignation letter. I had spent nearly eight years with Air New Zealand, and while it was difficult to leave, I knew it was the right decision. Shortly after, I received a thoughtful letter from the company expressing regret at my departure and thanking me for my service. It was a kind and personal gesture, and I truly appreciated it.&lt;br/&gt;Just after I resigned from Air New Zealand, we received the terrible news of an aircraft crash in Antarctica. After the delivery of the DC10 jumbo jet, Air New Zealand started sightseeing flights over the Antarctic. The Mount Erebus disaster occurred on 28 November 1979, when Air New Zealand Flight 901 flew into Mount Erebus on Ross Island, Antarctica, killing all 237 passengers and 20 crew members on board. Air New Zealand has been operating scheduled Antarctic sightseeing flights since 1977.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I was devastated by the news. I knew all the crew and had flown with them, especially the cabin crew. While I was never rostered for these flights, it could very well have been my turn. It took a long time to get over this tragedy.&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Erebus_disaster"&gt;If you would like to read more about the disaster&lt;/a&gt;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;br&gt;Around that time, New Zealand underwent a significant shift by removing most import licensing and opening the country to products from around the world. This change flooded the market with cheap imports, which posed challenges for local businesses like ours.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unfortunately, the removal of import licensing didn&rsquo;t benefit us much. While we could now import as much knitting yarn as needed, the prices remained unchanged. Within a month of this policy change, our wholesaler showed us samples of imported babywear he could source, along with the prices he&rsquo;d pay for them.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Having just left Air New Zealand, this wasn&rsquo;t the future we had envisioned. The imported products were incredibly cheap, and competing with those prices seemed almost impossible. We quickly realized we needed to rethink our approach if we wanted to continue operating. The move into the bigger home was great for the children, as each got their bedroom, and we had a rumpus room. We also installed a swimming pool, and we had great times all around.</p>
<p>However, having left Air New Zealand and with Magner Knitwear undergoing significant changes to remain competitive, I was unknowingly affected. I began to stress out and experienced periods of depression and anxiety, which I referred to as the "black dog." I tried to keep it to myself, but it probably showed when my alcohol intake increased. Unfortunately, Sheila bore the brunt of it all.&lt;br/&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This difficult period lasted for about 12 to 18 months. Eventually, the business stabilized, and we were making a living from it, but the enjoyment and creativity were gone. I decided it was time to change my lifestyle. I started jogging, joined a gym, and attended philosophy lessons twice a week for four years. I learned a lot from these lessons and have continued going to the gym for over 40 years.&lt;br/&gt;I also started to look for a new business opportunity. I had always been interested in real estate, so I decided to get my real estate license. I worked for a company called Barfoot &amp; Thompson, which was a great experience. I enjoyed the work and the people I met, but I found it challenging to make a living from it. I was used to a regular income, and real estate was very unpredictable. I decided to leave the industry and look for something else.</p>
<p>Around this time, we were approached by a company that wanted to buy Magner Knitwear. They offered us a good price, and we accepted. We sold the business and moved on to new ventures. It was a bittersweet moment, as we had put so much time and effort into building Magner Knitwear. However, it was time to let Magner Knitwear go. We had taken it as far as we could, so we placed it on the market, and it sold after about a year.</p>
